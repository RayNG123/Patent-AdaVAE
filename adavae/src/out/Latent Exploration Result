0,"In the ordinal matroid secretary problem (MSP), candidates do not reveal numerical weights, but the decision maker can still discern if a candidate is better than another. An algorithm 𝛼 is probability-competitive if every element from the optimum appears with probability 1/𝛼 in the output. This measure is stronger than the standard utility competitiveness. Our main result is the introduction of a technique based on forbidden sets to design algorithms with strong probability-competitive ratios on many matroid classes. We improve upon the guarantees for almost every matroid class considered in the MSP literature. In particular, we achieve probability-competitive ratios of 4 for graphic matroids and of 33‾√≈5.19 for laminar matroids. Additionally, we modify Kleinberg’s 1+𝑂(1/𝜌) utility-competitive algorithm for uniform matroids of rank 𝜌 in order to obtain a 1+𝑂(log𝜌/𝜌‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√) probability-competitive algorithm. We also contribute algorithms for the ordinal MSP on arbitrary matroids.

1,"In this paper, we study the performance of affine policies for a two-stage, adjustable, robust optimization problem with a fixed recourse and an uncertain right-hand side belonging to a budgeted uncertainty set. This is an important class of uncertainty sets, widely used in practice, in which we can specify a budget on the adversarial deviations of the uncertain parameters from the nominal values to adjust the level of conservatism. The two-stage adjustable robust optimization problem is hard to approximate within a factor better than 𝛺(log𝑛loglog𝑛) even for budget of uncertainty sets in which 𝑛 is the number of decision variables. Affine policies, in which the second-stage decisions are constrained to be an affine function of the uncertain parameters provide a tractable approximation for the problem and have been observed to exhibit good empirical performance. We show that affine policies give an 𝑂(log𝑛loglog𝑛)-approximation for the two-stage, adjustable, robust problem with fixed nonnegative recourse for budgeted uncertainty sets. This matches the hardness of approximation, and therefore, surprisingly, affine policies provide an optimal approximation for the problem (up to a constant factor). We also show strong theoretical performance bounds for affine policy for a significantly more general class of intersection of budgeted sets, including disjoint constrained budgeted sets, permutation invariant sets, and general intersection of budgeted sets. Our analysis relies on showing the existence of a near-optimal, feasible affine policy that satisfies certain nice structural properties. Based on these structural properties, we also present an alternate algorithm to compute a near-optimal affine solution that is significantly faster than computing the optimal affine policy by solving a large linear program.

2,"Diverse optimization algorithms correctly identify, in finite time, intrinsic constraints that must be active at optimality. Analogous behavior extends beyond optimization to systems involving partly smooth operators, and in particular to variational inequalities over partly smooth sets. As in classical nonlinear programming, such active‐set structure underlies the design of accelerated local algorithms of Newton type. We formalize this idea in broad generality as a simple linearization scheme for two intersecting manifolds.

3,"We consider a joint pricing and inventory control problem in which the customer’s response to selling price and the demand distribution are not known a priori. Unsatisfied demand is lost and unobserved, and the only available information for decision making is the observed sales data (also known as censored demand). Conventional approaches, such as stochastic approximation, online convex optimization, and continuum-armed bandit algorithms, cannot be employed, because neither the realized values of the profit function nor its derivatives are known. A major challenge of this problem lies in that the estimated profit function constructed from observed sales data is multimodal in price. We develop a nonparametric spline approximation–based learning algorithm. The algorithm separates the planning horizon into a disjoint exploration phase and an exploitation phase. During the exploration phase, a spline approximation of the demand-price function is constructed based on sales data, and then the corresponding surrogate optimization problem is solved on a sparse grid to obtain a pair of recommended price and target inventory level. During the exploitation phase, the algorithm implements the recommended strategies. We establish a (nearly) square-root regret rate, which (almost) matches the theoretical lower bound.

4,"We consider multiway cut, a basic graph partitioning problem in which the goal is to find the minimum weight collection of edges disconnecting a given set of special vertices called terminals. Multiway cut admits a well-known simplex embedding relaxation, where rounding this embedding is equivalent to partitioning the simplex. Current best-known solutions to the problem are comprised of a mix of several different ingredients, resulting in intricate algorithms. Moreover, the best of these algorithms is too complex to fully analyze analytically, and a computer was partly used in verifying its approximation factor. We propose a new approach to simplex partitioning and the multiway cut problem based on general transformations of the simplex that allow dependencies between the different variables. Our approach admits much simpler algorithms and, in addition, yields an approximation guarantee for the multiway cut problem that (roughly) matches the current best computer-verified approximation factor.

5,"We study ergodic properties of Markovian multiclass many-server queues that are uniform over scheduling policies and the size of the system. The system is heavily loaded in the Halfin–Whitt regime, and the scheduling policies are work conserving and preemptive. We provide a unified approach via a Lyapunov function method that establishes Foster–Lyapunov equations for both the limiting diffusion and the prelimit diffusion-scaled queuing processes simultaneously. We first study the limiting controlled diffusion and show that if the spare capacity (safety staffing) parameter is positive, the diffusion is exponentially ergodic uniformly over all stationary Markov controls, and the invariant probability measures have uniform exponential tails. This result is sharp because when there is no abandonment and the spare capacity parameter is negative, the controlled diffusion is transient under any Markov control. In addition, we show that if all the abandonment rates are positive, the invariant probability measures have sub-Gaussian tails regardless whether the spare capacity parameter is positive or negative. Using these results, we proceed to establish the corresponding ergodic properties for the diffusion-scaled queuing processes. In addition to providing a simpler proof of previous results in Gamarnik and Stolyar [Gamarnik D, Stolyar AL (2012) Multiclass multiserver queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic regime: asymptotics of the stationary distribution. Queueing Systems 71(1–2):25–51], we extend these results to multiclass models with renewal arrival processes, albeit under the assumption that the mean residual life functions are bounded. For the Markovian model with Poisson arrivals, we obtain stronger results and show that the convergence to the stationary distribution is at an exponential rate uniformly over all work-conserving stationary Markov scheduling policies.

6,"In multiperiod stochastic optimization problems, the future optimal decision is a random variable whose distribution depends on the parameters of the optimization problem. I analyze how the expected value of this random variable changes as a function of the dynamic optimization parameters in the context of Markov decision processes. I call this analysis stochastic comparative statics. I derive both comparative statics results and stochastic comparative statics results showing how the current and future optimal decisions change in response to changes in the single-period payoff function, the discount factor, the initial state of the system, and the transition probability function. I apply my results to various models from the economics and operations research literature, including investment theory, dynamic pricing models, controlled random walks, and comparisons of stationary distributions.

7,"Finitely many agents have preferences on a finite set of alternatives, single-peaked with respect to a connected graph with these alternatives as vertices. A probabilistic rule assigns to each preference profile a probability distribution over the alternatives. First, all unanimous and strategy-proof probabilistic rules are characterized when the graph is a tree. These rules are uniquely determined by their outcomes at those preference profiles at which all peaks are on leaves of the tree and, thus, extend the known case of a line graph. Second, it is shown that every unanimous and strategy-proof probabilistic rule is random dictatorial if and only if the graph has no leaves. Finally, the two results are combined to obtain a general characterization for every connected graph by using its block tree representation.

8,"Nonmonetary mechanisms for repeated allocation and decision making are gaining widespread use in many real-world settings. Our aim in this work is to study the performance and incentive properties of simple mechanisms based on artificial currencies in such settings. To this end, we make the following contributions: For a general allocation setting, we provide two black-box approaches to convert any one-shot monetary mechanism to a dynamic nonmonetary mechanism using an artificial currency that simultaneously guarantees vanishing gains from nontruthful reporting over time and vanishing losses in performance. The two mechanisms trade off between their applicability and their computational and informational requirements. Furthermore, for settings with two agents, we show that a particular artificial currency mechanism also results in a vanishing price of anarchy.

9,"Each capacity-filling and substitutable choice rule is known to have a maximizer-collecting representation: There exists a list of priority orderings such that from each choice set that includes more alternatives than the capacity, the choice is the union of the priority orderings’ maximizers. We introduce the notion of a critical set and constructively prove that the number of critical sets for a choice rule determines its smallest-size maximizer-collecting representation. We show that responsive choice rules require the maximal number of priority orderings in their smallest-size maximizer-collecting representations among all capacity-filling and substitutable choice rules. We also analyze maximizer-collecting choice rules in which the number of priority orderings equals the capacity. We show that if the capacity is greater than three and the number of alternatives exceeds the capacity by at least two, then no capacity-filling and substitutable choice rule has a maximizer-collecting representation of the size equal to the capacity.

10,"In a prior study [Ye HQ, Yao DD (2016) Diffusion limit of fair resource control–Stationary and interchange of limits. Math. Oper. Res. 41(4):1161–1207.] focusing on a class of stochastic processing network with fair resource control, we justified the diffusion approximation (in the context of the interchange of limits) provided that the pth moment of the workloads are bounded. To this end, we introduced the so-called bounded workload condition, which requires the workload process be bounded by a free process plus the initial workload. This condition is for a derived process, the workload, as opposed to primitives such as arrival processes and service requirements; as such, it could be difficult to verify. In this paper, we establish the interchange of limits under a moment condition of suitable order on the primitives directly: the required order is p∗>2(p+2) on the moments of the primitive processes so as to bound the pth moment of the workload. This moment condition is trivial to verify, and indeed automatically holds in networks where the primitives have moments of all orders, for instance, renewal arrivals with phase-type interarrival times and independent and identically distributed phase-type service times.

11,"We propose a model in which dividend payments occur at regular, deterministic intervals in an otherwise continuous model. This contrasts traditional models where either the payment of continuous dividends is controlled or the dynamics are given by discrete time processes. Moreover, between two dividend payments, the structure allows for other types of control; we consider the possibility of equity issuance at any point in time. The value is characterized as the fixed point of an optimal control problem with periodic initial and terminal conditions. We prove the regularity and uniqueness of the corresponding dynamic programming equation and the convergence of an efficient numerical algorithm that we use to study the problem. The model enables us to find the loss caused by infrequent dividend payments. We show that under realistic parameter values, this loss varies from around 1%–24% depending on the state of the system and that using the optimal policy from the continuous problem further increases the loss.

12,"Stochastic convex optimization, by which the objective is the expectation of a random convex function, is an important and widely used method with numerous applications in machine learning, statistics, operations research, and other areas. We study the complexity of stochastic convex optimization given only statistical query (SQ) access to the objective function. We show that well-known and popular first-order iterative methods can be implemented using only statistical queries. For many cases of interest, we derive nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the estimation (sample) complexity, including linear optimization in the most general setting. We then present several consequences for machine learning, differential privacy, and proving concrete lower bounds on the power of convex optimization–based methods. The key ingredient of our work is SQ algorithms and lower bounds for estimating the mean vector of a distribution over vectors supported on a convex body in Rd. This natural problem has not been previously studied, and we show that our solutions can be used to get substantially improved SQ versions of Perceptron and other online algorithms for learning halfspaces.

13,"We study statistical inference and distributionally robust solution methods for stochastic optimization problems, focusing on confidence intervals for optimal values and solutions that achieve exact coverage asymptotically. We develop a generalized empirical likelihood framework—based on distributional uncertainty sets constructed from nonparametric f-divergence balls—for Hadamard differentiable functionals, and in particular, stochastic optimization problems. As consequences of this theory, we provide a principled method for choosing the size of distributional uncertainty regions to provide one- and two-sided confidence intervals that achieve exact coverage. We also give an asymptotic expansion for our distributionally robust formulation, showing how robustification regularizes problems by their variance. Finally, we show that optimizers of the distributionally robust formulations we study enjoy (essentially) the same consistency properties as those in classical sample average approximations. Our general approach applies to quickly mixing stationary sequences, including geometrically ergodic Harris recurrent Markov chains.

14,"We present a new type of unsupervised learning problem in which we find a small set of representative regions that approximates a larger data set. These regions may be presented to a practitioner along with additional information in order to help the practitioner explore the data set. An advantage of this approach is that it does not rely on cluster structure of the data. We formally define this problem, and we present axioms that should be satisfied by functions that measure the quality of representatives. We provide a quality function that satisfies all of these axioms. Using this quality function, we formulate two optimization problems for finding representatives. We provide convergence results for a general class of methods, and we show that these results apply to several specific methods, including methods derived from the solution of the optimization problems formulated in this paper. We provide an example of how representative regions may be used to explore a data set.

15,"The multilinear polytope of a hypergraph is the convex hull of a set of binary points satisfying a collection of multilinear equations. We introduce the running intersection inequalities, a new class of facet-defining inequalities for the multilinear polytope. Accordingly, we define a new polyhedral relaxation of the multilinear polytope, referred to as the running intersection relaxation, and identify conditions under which this relaxation is tight. Namely, we show that for kite-free beta-acyclic hypergraphs, a class that lies between gamma-acyclic and beta-acyclic hypergraphs, the running intersection relaxation coincides with the multilinear polytope and it admits a polynomial size extended formulation.

16,"We study the problem of fair allocation for indivisible goods. We use the maximin share paradigm introduced by Budish [Budish E (2011) The combinatorial assignment problem: Approximate competitive equilibrium from equal incomes. J. Political Econom. 119(6):1061–1103.] as a measure of fairness. Kurokawa et al. [Kurokawa D, Procaccia AD, Wang J (2018) Fair enough: Guaranteeing approximate maximin shares. J. ACM 65(2):8.] were the first to investigate this fundamental problem in the additive setting. They showed that in delicately constructed examples, not everyone can obtain a utility of at least her maximin value. They mitigated this impossibility result with a beautiful observation: no matter how the utility functions are made, we always can allocate the items to the agents to guarantee each agent’s utility is at least 2/3 of her maximin value. They left open whether this bound can be improved. Our main contribution answers this question in the affirmative. We improve their approximation result to a 3/4 factor guarantee.

17,"We study time-varying semidefinite programs (TV-SDPs), which are semidefinite programs whose data (and solutions) are functions of time. Our focus is on the setting where the data vary polynomially with time. We show that under a strict feasibility assumption, restricting the solutions to also be polynomial functions of time does not change the optimal value of the TV-SDP. Moreover, by using a Positivstellensatz (positive locus theorem) on univariate polynomial matrices, we show that the best polynomial solution of a given degree to a TV-SDP can be found by solving a semidefinite program of tractable size. We also provide a sequence of dual problems that can be cast as SDPs and that give upper bounds on the optimal value of a TV-SDP (in maximization form). We prove that under a boundedness assumption, this sequence of upper bounds converges to the optimal value of the TV-SDP. Under the same assumption, we also show that the optimal value of the TV-SDP is attained. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on a maximum-flow problem with time-varying edge capacities, a wireless coverage problem with time-varying coverage requirements, and on biobjective semidefinite optimization where the goal is to approximate the Pareto curve in one shot.

18,"We present a new class of polynomial-time algorithms for submodular function minimization (SFM) as well as a unified framework to obtain strongly polynomial SFM algorithms. Our algorithms are based on simple iterative methods for the minimum-norm problem, such as the conditional gradient and Fujishige–Wolfe algorithms. We exhibit two techniques to turn simple iterative methods into polynomial-time algorithms. First, we adapt the geometric rescaling technique, which has recently gained attention in linear programming, to SFM and obtain a weakly polynomial bound 𝑂((𝑛4·EO+𝑛5)log(𝑛𝐿)). Second, we exhibit a general combinatorial black box approach to turn 𝜀𝐿-approximate SFM oracles into strongly polynomial exact SFM algorithms. This framework can be applied to a wide range of combinatorial and continuous algorithms, including pseudo-polynomial ones. In particular, we can obtain strongly polynomial algorithms by a repeated application of the conditional gradient or of the Fujishige–Wolfe algorithm. Combined with the geometric rescaling technique, the black box approach provides an 𝑂((𝑛5·EO+𝑛6)log2𝑛) algorithm. Finally, we show that one of the techniques we develop in the paper can also be combined with the cutting-plane method of Lee et al., yielding a simplified variant of their 𝑂(𝑛3log2𝑛·EO+𝑛4log𝑂(1)𝑛) algorithm.

19,"The notion of “tail risk” has been a crucial consideration in modern risk management and financial regulation, as very well documented in the recent regulatory documents. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the tail risk, we carry out an axiomatic study for risk measures that quantify the tail risk, that is, the behaviour of a risk beyond a certain quantile. Such risk measures are referred to as tail risk measures in this paper. The two popular classes of regulatory risk measures in banking and insurance, value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall, are prominent, yet elementary, examples of tail risk measures. We establish a connection between a tail risk measure and a corresponding law-invariant risk measure, called its generator, and investigate their joint properties. A tail risk measure inherits many properties from its generator, but not subadditivity or convexity; nevertheless, a tail risk measure is coherent if and only if its generator is coherent. We explore further relevant issues on tail risk measures, such as bounds, distortion risk measures, risk aggregation, elicitability, and dual representations. In particular, there is no elicitable tail convex risk measure other than the essential supremum, and under a continuity condition, the only elicitable and positively homogeneous monetary tail risk measures are the VaRs.

21,"We introduce a new notion of conditional nonlinear expectation under probability distortion. Such a distorted nonlinear expectation is not subadditive in general, so it is beyond the scope of Peng’s framework of nonlinear expectations. A more fundamental problem when extending the distorted expectation to a dynamic setting is time inconsistency, that is, the usual “tower property” fails. By localizing the probability distortion and restricting to a smaller class of random variables, we introduce a so-called distorted probability and construct a conditional expectation in such a way that it coincides with the original nonlinear expectation at time zero, but has a time-consistent dynamics in the sense that the tower property remains valid. Furthermore, we show that in the continuous time model this conditional expectation corresponds to a parabolic differential equation whose coefficient involves the law of the underlying diffusion. This work is the first step toward a new understanding of nonlinear expectations under probability distortion and will potentially be a helpful tool for solving time-inconsistent stochastic optimization problems.

22,"We propose a connection between finite zero-sum stochastic games (henceforth stochastic games) and multiparameter eigenvalue problems. This connection, which relies on the theory developed by Shapley and Snow for matrix games, opens new possibilities in the study of stochastic games. In particular, we derive from this connection a handful of new results for stochastic games.

23,"We consider a model of intertemporal choice where time is a continuum, the set of instantaneous outcomes (e.g., consumption bundles) is a topological space, and intertemporal plans (e.g., consumption streams) must be continuous functions of time. We assume that the agent can form preferences over plans defined on open time intervals. We axiomatically characterize the intertemporal preferences that admit a representation via discounted utility integrals. In this representation, the utility function is continuous and unique up to positive affine transformations, and the discount structure is represented by a unique Riemann–Stieltjes integral plus a unique linear functional measuring the long-run asymptotic utility.

24,"This corrigendum fixes an incorrect claim in the paper Gupta et al. [Gupta V, Moseley B, Uetz M, Xie Q (2020) Greed works—online algorithms for unrelated machine stochastic scheduling. Math. Oper. Res. 45(2):497–516.], which led us to claim a performance guarantee of 6 for a greedy algorithm for deterministic online scheduling with release times on unrelated machines. The result is based on an upper bound on the increase of the objective function value when adding an additional job 𝑗 to a machine 𝑖 (Gupta et al., lemma 6). It was pointed out by Sven Jäger from Technische Universität Berlin that this upper bound may fail to hold. We here present a modified greedy algorithm and analysis, which leads to a performance guarantee of 7.216 instead. Correspondingly, also the claimed performance guarantee of (6+3𝛥)ℎ(𝛥) in theorem 4 of Gupta et al. for the stochastic online problem has to be corrected. We obtain a performance bound (7.216+3.608𝛥)ℎ(𝛥).

25,"This paper analyzes a sequential social learning game with a general utility function, state, and action space. We show that asymptotic learning holds for every utility function if and only if signals are totally unbounded, that is, the support of the private posterior probability of every event contains both zero and one. For the case of finitely many actions, we provide a sufficient condition for asymptotic learning depending on the given utility function. Finally, we establish that for the important class of simple utility functions with finitely many actions and states, pairwise unbounded signals, which generally are a strictly weaker notion than unbounded signals, are necessary and sufficient for asymptotic learning.

26,"We consider a mean field game (MFG) of optimal portfolio liquidation under asymmetric information. We prove that the solution to the MFG can be characterized in terms of a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) with a possibly singular terminal condition on the backward component or, equivalently, in terms of an FBSDE with a finite terminal value yet a singular driver. Extending the method of continuation to linear-quadratic FBSDEs with a singular driver, we prove that the MFG has a unique solution. Our existence and uniqueness result allows proving that the MFG with a possibly singular terminal condition can be approximated by a sequence of MFGs with finite terminal values.

27,"The aim of this paper is to analyze a general class of storage processes, in which the rate at which the storage level increases or decreases is assumed to be an affine function of the current storage level, and, in addition, both upward and downward jumps are allowed. To do so, we first focus on a related insurance risk model, for which we determine the ruin probability at an exponentially distributed epoch jointly with the corresponding undershoot and overshoot, given that the capital level at time 0 is exponentially distributed as well. The obtained results for this insurance risk model can be translated in terms of two types of storage models, in one of those two cases by exploiting a duality relation. Many well-studied models are shown to be special cases of our insurance risk and storage models. We conclude by showing how the exponentiality assumptions can be greatly relaxed.

28,"Many applications in machine learning or signal processing involve nonsmooth optimization problems. This nonsmoothness brings a low-dimensional structure to the optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a randomized proximal gradient method harnessing this underlying structure. We introduce two key components: (i) a random subspace proximal gradient algorithm; and (ii) an identification-based sampling of the subspaces.

29,"In this paper, we provide a full conjugacy and subdifferential calculus for convex convex-composite functions in finite-dimensional space. Our approach, based on infimal convolution and cone convexity, is straightforward. The results are established under a verifiable Slater-type condition, with relaxed monotonicity and without lower semicontinuity assumptions on the functions in play. The versatility of our findings is illustrated by a series of applications in optimization and matrix analysis, including conic programming, matrix-fractional, variational Gram, and spectral functions.

30,"We analyze a mean field tournament: a mean field game in which the agents receive rewards according to the ranking of the terminal value of their projects and are subject to cost of effort. Using Schrödinger bridges we are able to explicitly calculate the equilibrium. This allows us to identify the reward functions which would yield a desired equilibrium and solve several related mechanism design problems. We are also able to identify the effect of reward inequality on the players’ welfare as well as calculate the price of anarchy.

31,"We study a certain polytope depending on a graph G and a parameter β ∈ (0,1) that arises from embedding the Hamiltonian cycle problem in a discounted Markov decision process. Literature suggests a conjecture a lower bound on the proportion of feasible bases corresponding to Hamiltonian cycles in the set of all feasible bases. We make progress toward a proof of the conjecture by proving results about the structure of feasible bases. In particular, we prove three main results: (1) the set of feasible bases is independent of the parameter β when the parameter is close to one, (2) the polytope can be interpreted as a generalized network flow polytope, and (3) we deduce a combinatorial interpretation of the feasible bases. We also provide a full characterization for a special class of feasible bases, and we apply this to provide some computational support for the conjecture.

32,"This paper is concerned with finding an optimal algorithm for minimizing a composite convex objective function. The basic setting is that the objective is the sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the dth-order derivative information available, and the second function is possibly nonsmooth, but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed approximately in an efficient manner. The problem is to find—in that setting—the best possible (optimal) iteration complexity for convex optimization. Along that line, for the smooth case (without the second nonsmooth part in the objective), Nesterov proposed an optimal algorithm for the first-order methods (𝑑=1) with iteration complexity 𝑂(1/𝑘2), whereas high-order tensor algorithms (using up to general dth-order tensor information) with iteration complexity 𝑂(1/𝑘𝑑+1) were recently established. In this paper, we propose a new high-order tensor algorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity of 𝑂(1/𝑘(3𝑑+1)/2), which matches the lower bound for the dth-order methods as previously established and hence is optimal. Our approach is based on the accelerated hybrid proximal extragradient (A-HPE) framework proposed by Monteiro and Svaiter, where a bisection procedure is installed for each A-HPE iteration. At each bisection step, a proximal tensor subproblem is approximately solved, and the total number of bisection steps per A-HPE iteration is shown to be bounded by a logarithmic factor in the precision required.

33,"This paper analyzes a monopoly firm’s profit-maximizing mechanism in the following context. There is a continuum of consumers with a unit demand for a good. The distribution of the consumers’ valuations is given by one of two possible demand distributions/states. The consumers are uncertain about the demand state, and they update their beliefs after observing their own valuation for the good. The firm is uncertain about the demand state but infers it from the consumers’ reported valuations. The firm’s problem is to maximize profits by choosing an optimal mechanism among the class of anonymous, deterministic, direct revelation mechanisms that satisfy interim incentive compatibility and ex post individual rationality. We show that, under certain sufficient conditions, the firm’s optimal mechanism is to set the monopoly price in each demand state. Under these conditions, Segal’s optimal ex post mechanism is robust to relaxing ex post incentive compatibility to interim incentive compatibility.

34,"Consider a dominance relation (a preorder) ≿ on a topological space X, such as the greater than or equal to relation on a function space or a stochastic dominance relation on a space of probability measures. Given a compact set K ⊆ X, we study when a continuous real function on K that is strictly monotonic with respect to ≿ can be extended to X without violating the continuity and monotonicity conditions. We show that such extensions exist for translation invariant dominance relations on a large class of topological vector spaces. Translation invariance or a vector structure are no longer needed when X is locally compact and second countable. In decision theoretic exercises, our extension theorems help construct monotonic utility functions on the universal space X starting from compact subsets. To illustrate, we prove several representation theorems for revealed or exogenously given preferences that are monotonic with respect to a dominance relation.

35,"The classic prophet inequality states that, when faced with a finite sequence of nonnegative independent random variables, a gambler who knows the distribution and is allowed to stop the sequence at any time, can obtain, in expectation, at least half as much reward as a prophet who knows the values of each random variable and can choose the largest one. In this work, we consider the situation in which the sequence comes in random order. We look at both a nonadaptive and an adaptive version of the problem. In the former case, the gambler sets a threshold for every random variable a priori, whereas, in the latter case, the thresholds are set when a random variable arrives. For the nonadaptive case, we obtain an algorithm achieving an expected reward within at least a 0.632 fraction of the expected maximum and prove that this constant is optimal. For the adaptive case with independent and identically distributed random variables, we obtain a tight 0.745-approximation, solving a problem posed by Hill and Kertz in 1982. We also apply these prophet inequalities to posted price mechanisms, and we prove the same tight bounds for both a nonadaptive and an adaptive posted price mechanism when buyers arrive in random order.

36,"It is well known that state-of-the-art linear programming solvers are more efficient than their semidefinite programming counterparts and can scale to much larger problem sizes. This leads us to consider the question, how well can we approximate semidefinite programs with linear programs? In this paper, we prove lower bounds on the size of linear programs that approximate the positive semidefinite cone. Let D be the set of n × n positive semidefinite matrices of trace equal to one. We prove two results on the hardness of approximating D with polytopes. We show that if 0 < ε < 1and A is an arbitrary matrix of trace equal to one, any polytope P such that (1-ε) (D-A) ⊂ P ⊂ D-A must have linear programming extension complexity at least exp(𝑐𝑛√), where c > 0 is a constant that depends on ε. Second, we show that any polytope P such that D ⊂ P and such that the Gaussian width of P is at most twice the Gaussian width of D must have extension complexity at least exp(𝑐𝑛13/). Our bounds are both superpolynomial in n and demonstrate that there is no generic way of approximating semidefinite programs with compact linear programs. The main ingredient of our proofs is hypercontractivity of the noise operator on the hypercube.

37,"In this paper we provide a general mathematical framework for distributional transforms, which allows for many examples that are used extensively in the literature of finance, economics, and optimization. We put a special focus on the class of probability distortions, which is a fundamental tool in decision theory. As our main results, we characterize distributional transforms satisfying various properties, and this includes an equivalent set of conditions which forces a distributional transform to be a probability distortion. As the first application, we construct new risk measures using distributional transforms. Sufficient and necessary conditions are given to ensure the convexity or coherence of the generated risk measures. In the second application, we introduce a new method for sensitivity analysis of risk measures based on composition groups of probability distortions. Finally, we construct probability distortions describing a change of measures with an example in option pricing.

38,"We investigate minimal and locally edge minimal fluid models for real-time resource-sharing networks, which are natural counterparts of pathwise minimal and locally edge minimal performance processes for the corresponding real-time stochastic systems. The models under study arise as optimizers of appropriate idleness-based criteria within a suitable family of fluid models for a given resource-sharing network. The class of minimal fluid models is fairly general, corresponding to efficient service protocols in which transmission on each route takes place in the earliest deadline first (EDF) order. For such a model, the distribution of the current lead times of the fluid mass on each route coincides with the fluid arrival measure for this route, truncated below on the current frontier level. Locally edge minimal fluid models may be regarded, in some sense, as fluid counterparts of EDF resource-sharing networks. Under mild assumptions, a locally edge minimal fluid model is uniquely determined by its data. We also show stability of such models in the strictly subcritical case. More generally, each such a subcritical model converges to the invariant manifold in finite time.

39,"In finite games, mixed Nash equilibria always exist, but pure equilibria may fail to exist. To assess the relevance of this nonexistence, we consider games where the payoffs are drawn at random. In particular, we focus on games where a large number of players can each choose one of two possible strategies and the payoffs are independent and identically distributed with the possibility of ties. We provide asymptotic results about the random number of pure Nash equilibria, such as fast growth and a central limit theorem, with bounds for the approximation error. Moreover, by using a new link between percolation models and game theory, we describe in detail the geometry of pure Nash equilibria and show that, when the probability of ties is small, a best-response dynamics reaches a pure Nash equilibrium with a probability that quickly approaches one as the number of players grows. We show that various phase transitions depend only on a single parameter of the model, that is, the probability of having ties.

40,"This paper is concerned with the derivation of first- and second-order sufficient optimality conditions for optimistic bilevel optimization problems involving smooth functions. First-order sufficient optimality conditions are obtained by estimating the tangent cone to the feasible set of the bilevel program in terms of initial problem data. This is done by exploiting several different reformulations of the hierarchical model as a single-level problem. To obtain second-order sufficient optimality conditions, we exploit the so-called value function reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem, which is then tackled with the aid of second-order directional derivatives. The resulting conditions can be stated in terms of initial problem data in several interesting situations comprising the settings where the lower level is linear or possesses strongly stable solutions.

41,"A set function is called XOS if it can be represented by the maximum of additive functions. When such a representation is fixed, the number of additive functions required to define the XOS function is called the width. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing XOS functions in the value oracle model. The problem is trivial for the XOS functions of width 1 because they are just additive, but it is already nontrivial even when the width is restricted to 2. We show two types of tight bounds on the polynomial-time approximability for this problem. First, in general, the approximation bound is between O(n) and Ω(n/logn)𝛺(𝑛/log𝑛), and exactly θ(n/logn)𝛉(𝑛/log𝑛) if randomization is allowed, where n is the ground set size. Second, when the width of the input XOS functions is bounded by a constant k ≥ 2, the approximation bound is between k − 1 and k − 1 − ɛ for any ɛ > 0. In particular, we give a linear-time algorithm to find an exact maximizer of a given XOS function of width 2, whereas we show that any exact algorithm requires an exponential number of value oracle calls even when the width is restricted to 3.

42,"Consider a switched queueing network with general routing among its queues. The MaxWeight policy assigns available service by maximizing the objective function ∑𝑗𝑄𝑗𝜎𝑗 among the different feasible service options, where 𝑄𝑗 denotes queue size and 𝜎𝑗 denotes the amount of service to be executed at queue 𝑗. MaxWeight is a greedy policy that does not depend on knowledge of arrival rates and is straightforward to implement. These properties and its simple formulation suggest MaxWeight as a serious candidate for implementation in the setting of switched queueing networks; MaxWeight has been extensively studied in the context of communication networks. However, a fluid model variant of MaxWeight was previously shown not to be maximally stable. Here, we prove that MaxWeight itself is not in general maximally stable. We also prove MaxWeight is maximally stable in a much more restrictive setting, and that a weighted version of MaxWeight, where the weighting depends on the traffic intensity, is always stable.

43,"We study the dynamic assortment planning problem, where for each arriving customer, the seller offers an assortment of substitutable products and the customer makes the purchase among offered products according to an uncapacitated multinomial logit (MNL) model. Because all the utility parameters of the MNL model are unknown, the seller needs to simultaneously learn customers’ choice behavior and make dynamic decisions on assortments based on the current knowledge. The goal of the seller is to maximize the expected revenue, or, equivalently, to minimize the expected regret. Although dynamic assortment planning problem has received an increasing attention in revenue management, most existing policies require the estimation of mean utility for each product and the final regret usually involves the number of products 𝑁N. The optimal regret of the dynamic assortment planning problem under the most basic and popular choice model—the MNL model—is still open. By carefully analyzing a revenue potential function, we develop a trisection-based policy combined with adaptive confidence bound construction, which achieves an item-independent regret bound of 𝑂(𝑇‾‾√)O(T), where 𝑇T is the length of selling horizon. We further establish the matching lower bound result to show the optimality of our policy. There are two major advantages of the proposed policy. First, the regret of all our policies has no dependence on 𝑁N. Second, our policies are almost assumption-free: there is no assumption on mean utility nor any “separability” condition on the expected revenues for different assortments. We also extend our trisection search algorithm to capacitated MNL models and obtain the optimal regret 𝑂˜(𝑁𝑇‾‾‾‾√)O˜(NT) (up to logrithmic factors) without any assumption on the mean utility parameters of items.
",We consider a dynamic pricing problem in which a customer’s purchase decision is dependent on the customer’s purchase history.

The customer’s purchase history is a continuous variable that is determined by the customer’s purchase history.

44,"The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization. Several semidefinite programming relaxations have been proposed recently that exploit a variety of mathematical structures including, for example, algebraic connectivity, permutation matrices, and association schemes. The main results of this paper are twofold. First, de Klerk and Sotirov [de Klerk E, Sotirov R (2012) Improved semidefinite programming bounds for quadratic assignment problems with suitable symmetry. Math. Programming 133(1):75–91.] present a semidefinite program (SDP) based on permutation matrices and symmetry reduction; they show that it is incomparable to the subtour elimination linear program but generally dominates it on small instances. We provide a family of simplicial TSP instances that shows that the integrality gap of this SDP is unbounded. Second, we show that these simplicial TSP instances imply the unbounded integrality gap of every SDP relaxation of the TSP mentioned in the survey on SDP relaxations of the TSP in section 2 of Sotirov [Sotirov R (2012) SDP relaxations for some combinatorial optimization problems.

In contrast, the subtour linear program performs perfectly on simplicial instances. The simplicial instances thus form a natural litmus test for future SDP relaxations of the TSP.

45,"The subject of this paper is the problem of optimal stopping of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with unknown distribution. We propose a stopping rule that is based on relative ranks and study its performance as measured by the maximal relative regret over suitable nonparametric classes of distributions. It is shown that the proposed rule is first-order asymptotically optimal and nearly rate optimal in terms of the rate at which the relative regret converges to zero. We also develop a general method for numerical solution of sequential stopping problems with no distributional information and use it in order to implement the proposed stopping rule. Some numerical experiments illustrating performance of the rule are presented as well.
",We propose a new method for the optimization of the stochastic optimization problem with stochastic uncertainty. The method is based on the assumption that the uncertainty is bounded by a set of discrete variables. We show that the method can be used to obtain a set of stochastic uncertainty bounds for the problem with stochastic uncertainty. We also show that the method can be used to obtain a set of stochastic uncertainty bounds for the problem with stochastic uncertainty. We also show that the method can be used to obtain a set of stochastic uncertainty bounds for the problem with stochastic uncertainty.

46,"We consider dynamic equilibria for flows over time under the fluid queuing model. In this model, queues on the links of a network take care of flow propagation. Flow enters the network at a single source and leaves at a single sink. In a dynamic equilibrium, every infinitesimally small flow particle reaches the sink as early as possible given the pattern of the rest of the flow. Although this model has been examined for many decades, progress has been relatively recent. In particular, the derivatives of dynamic equilibria have been characterized as thin flows with resetting, which allows for more structural results. Our two main results are based on the formulation of thin flows with resetting as a linear complementarity problem and its analysis. We present a constructive proof of existence for dynamic equilibria if the inflow rate is right-monotone. The complexity of computing thin flows with resetting, which occurs as a subproblem in this method, is still open. We settle it for the class of two-terminal, series-parallel networks by giving a recursive algorithm that solves the problem for all flow values simultaneously in polynomial time.

We prove that in POMDPs with long-run average objective, the decision maker has approximately optimal strategies with finite memory. This implies notably that approximating the long-run value is recursively enumerable, as well as a weak continuity property of the value with respect to the transition function.

49,"We analyze multilayer neural networks in the asymptotic regime of simultaneously (a) large network sizes and (b) large numbers of stochastic gradient descent training iterations. We rigorously establish the limiting behavior of the multilayer neural network output. The limit procedure is valid for any number of hidden layers, and it naturally also describes the limiting behavior of the training loss. The ideas that we explore are to (a) take the limits of each hidden layer sequentially and (b) characterize the evolution of parameters in terms of their initialization. The limit satisfies a system of deterministic integro-differential equations. The proof uses methods from weak convergence and stochastic analysis. We show that, under suitable assumptions on the activation functions and the behavior for large times, the limit neural network recovers a global minimum (with zero loss for the objective function).

50,"We study the interaction between multiple information designers who try to influence the behavior of a set of agents. When each designer can choose information policies from a compact set of statistical experiments with countable support, such games always admit subgame-perfect equilibria. When designers produce public information, every equilibrium of the simple game in which the set of messages coincides with the set of states is robust in the sense that it is an equilibrium with larger and possibly infinite and uncountable message sets. The converse is true for a class of Markovian equilibria only. When designers produce information for their own corporation of agents, robust pure-strategy equilibria exist and are characterized via an auxiliary normal-form game in which the set of strategies of each designer is the set of outcomes induced by Bayes correlated equilibria in her corporation.

51,"Orthogonal direct-sum decompositions of finite games into potential, harmonic and nonstrategic components exist in the literature. In this paper we study the issue of decomposing games that are strategically equivalent from a game-theoretical point of view, for instance games obtained via transformations such as duplications of strategies or positive affine mappings of the payoffs. We show the need to define classes of decompositions to achieve commutativity of game transformations and decompositions.

52,"We investigate the stochastic optimization problem of minimizing population risk, where the loss defining the risk is assumed to be weakly convex. Compositions of Lipschitz convex functions with smooth maps are the primary examples of such losses. We analyze the estimation quality of such nonsmooth and nonconvex problems by their sample average approximations. Our main results establish dimension-dependent rates on subgradient estimation in full generality and dimension-independent rates when the loss is a generalized linear model. As an application of the developed techniques, we analyze the nonsmooth landscape of a robust nonlinear regression problem.

53,"For the M/M/1+M model at the law-of-large-numbers scale, the long-run reneging count per unit time does not depend on the individual (i.e., per customer) reneging rate. This paradoxical statement has a simple proof. Less obvious is a large deviations analogue of this fact, stated as follows: the decay rate of the probability that the long-run reneging count per unit time is atypically large or atypically small does not depend on the individual reneging rate. In this paper, the sample path large deviations principle for the model is proved and the rate function is computed. Next, large time asymptotics for the reneging rate are studied for the case when the arrival rate exceeds the service rate. The key ingredient is a calculus of variations analysis of the variational problem associated with atypical reneging. A characterization of the aforementioned decay rate, given explicitly in terms of the arrival and service rate parameters of the model, is provided yielding a precise mathematical description of this paradoxical behavior.

54,"In this paper, we present a new model and mechanisms for auctions in two-sided markets of buyers and sellers, where budget constraints are imposed on buyers. Our model incorporates polymatroidal environments and is applicable to a variety of models that include multiunit auctions, matching markets, and reservation exchange markets. Our mechanisms are built on the polymatroidal network flow model by Lawler and Martel. Additionally, they feature nice properties such as the incentive compatibility of buyers, individual rationality, Pareto optimality, and strong budget balance. The first mechanism is a two-sided generalization of the polyhedral clinching auction by Goel et al. for one-sided markets. The second mechanism is a reduce-to-recover algorithm that reduces the market to be one-sided, applies the polyhedral clinching auction by Goel et al., and lifts the resulting allocation to the original two-sided market via the polymatroidal network flow. Both mechanisms are implemented by polymatroid algorithms. We demonstrate how our framework is applied to the Internet display advertisement auctions.

55,"We bound the variance and other moments of a random vector based on the range of its realizations, thus generalizing inequalities of Popoviciu and of Bhatia and Davis concerning measures on the line to several dimensions. This is done using convex duality and (infinite-dimensional) linear programming. The following consequence of our bounds exhibits symmetry breaking, provides a new proof of Jung’s theorem, and turns out to have applications to the aggregation dynamics modelling attractive–repulsive interactions: among probability measures on 𝐑𝑛 whose support has diameter at most 2‾√, we show that the variance around the mean is maximized precisely by those measures that assign mass 1/(𝑛+1) to each vertex of a standard simplex. For 1≤𝑝<∞, the 𝑝 th moment—optimally centered—is maximized by the same measures among those satisfying the diameter constraint.

56,"We present a framework to obtain valid inequalities for a reverse convex set: the set of points in a polyhedron that lie outside a given open convex set. Reverse convex sets arise in many models, including bilevel optimization and polynomial optimization. An intersection cut is a well-known valid inequality for a reverse convex set that is generated from a basic solution that lies within the convex set. We introduce a framework for deriving valid inequalities for the reverse convex set from basic solutions that lie outside the convex set. We first propose an extension to intersection cuts that defines a two-term disjunction for a reverse convex set, which we refer to as an intersection disjunction. Next, we generalize this analysis to a multiterm disjunction by considering the convex set’s recession directions. These disjunctions can be used in a cut-generating linear program to obtain valid inequalities for the reverse convex set.

57,"We investigate the value function of an infinite horizon variational problem in the infinite-dimensional setting. First, we provide an upper estimate of its Dini–Hadamard subdifferential in terms of the Clarke subdifferential of the Lipschitz continuous integrand and the Clarke normal cone to the graph of the set-valued mapping describing dynamics. Second, we derive a necessary condition for optimality in the form of an adjoint inclusion that grasps a connection between the Euler–Lagrange condition and the maximum principle. The main results are applied to the derivation of the necessary optimality condition of the spatial Ramsey growth model.

58,"We consider a general class of nonzero-sum N-player stochastic games with impulse controls, where players control the underlying dynamics with discrete interventions. We adopt a veri?cation approach and provide su?cient conditions for the Nash equilibria (NEs) of the game. We then consider the limiting situation when N goes to in?nity, that is, a suitable mean-?eld game (MFG) with impulse controls. We show that under appropriate technical conditions, there exists a unique NE solution to the MFG, which is an ϵ-NE approximation to the N-player game, with ϵ=𝑂1𝑁√. As an example, we analyze in detail a class of two-player stochastic games which extends the classical cash management problem to the game setting. In particular, we present numerical analysis for the cases of the single player, the two-player game, and the MFG, showing the impact of competition on the player’s optimal strategy, with sensitivity analysis of the model parameters.

59,"The solution concept of a Bayesian equilibrium of a Bayesian game is inherently an interim concept. The corresponding ex ante solution concept has been termed a Harsányi equilibrium; examples have appeared in the literature showing that there are Bayesian games with uncountable state spaces that have no Bayesian approximate equilibria but do admit a Harsányi approximate equilibrium, thus exhibiting divergent behaviour in the ex ante and interim stages. Smoothness, a concept from descriptive set theory, has been shown in previous works to guarantee the existence of Bayesian equilibria. We show here that higher rungs in the countable Borel equivalence relation hierarchy can also shed light on equilibrium existence. In particular, hyperfiniteness, the next step above smoothness, is a sufficient condition for the existence of Harsányi approximate equilibria in purely atomic Bayesian games.

61,"The paper is devoted to a comprehensive study of composite models in variational analysis and optimization the importance of which for numerous theoretical, algorithmic, and applied issues of operations research is difficult to overstate. The underlying theme of our study is a systematical replacement of conventional metric regularity and related requirements by much weaker metric subregulatity ones that lead us to significantly stronger and completely new results of first-order and second-order variational analysis and optimization. In this way, we develop extended calculus rules for first-order and second-order generalized differential constructions while paying the main attention in second-order variational theory to the new and rather large class of fully subamenable compositions. Applications to optimization include deriving enhanced no-gap second-order optimality conditions in constrained composite models, complete characterizations of the uniqueness of Lagrange multipliers, strong metric subregularity of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker systems in parametric optimization, and so on.

62,"Let 𝐺 be an instance of the stable marriage problem in which every vertex ranks its neighbors in a strict order of preference. A matching 𝑀 in 𝐺 is popular if 𝑀 does not lose a head-to-head election against any matching. Popular matchings generalize stable matchings. Unfortunately, when there are edge costs, to find or even approximate up to any factor a popular matching of minimum cost is NP-hard. Let opt be the cost of a min-cost popular matching. Our goal is to efficiently compute a matching of cost at most opt by paying the price of mildly relaxing popularity. Our main positive results are two bicriteria algorithms that find in polynomial time a “quasi-popular” matching of cost at most opt. Moreover, one of the algorithms finds a quasi-popular matching of cost at most that of a min-cost popular fractional matching, which could be much smaller than opt. Key to the other algorithm is a polynomial-size extended formulation for an integral polytope sandwiched between the popular and quasi-popular matching polytopes. We complement these results by showing that it is NP-hard to find a quasi-popular matching of minimum cost and that both the popular and quasi-popular matching polytopes have near-exponential extension complexity.

63,"This article poses the following problem: Does there exist a probability distribution over subsets of a finite partially ordered set (poset), such that a set of constraints involving marginal probabilities of the poset’s elements and maximal chains is satisfied? We present a combinatorial algorithm to positively resolve this question. The algorithm can be implemented in polynomial time in the special case where maximal chain probabilities are affine functions of their elements. This existence problem is relevant for the equilibrium characterization of a generic strategic interdiction game on a capacitated flow network. The game involves a routing entity that sends its flow through the network while facing path transportation costs and an interdictor who simultaneously interdicts one or more edges while facing edge interdiction costs. Using our existence result on posets and strict complementary slackness in linear programming, we show that the Nash equilibria of this game can be fully described using primal and dual solutions of a minimum-cost circulation problem. Our analysis provides a new characterization of the critical components in the interdiction game. It also leads to a polynomial-time approach for equilibrium computation.

65,"This paper suggests two novel ideas to develop new proximal variable-metric methods for solving a class of composite convex optimization problems. The first idea is to utilize a new parameterization strategy of the optimality condition to design a class of homotopy proximal variable-metric algorithms that can achieve linear convergence and finite global iteration-complexity bounds. We identify at least three subclasses of convex problems in which our approach can apply to achieve linear convergence rates. The second idea is a new primal-dual-primal framework for implementing proximal Newton methods that has attractive computational features for a subclass of nonsmooth composite convex minimization problems. We specialize the proposed algorithm to solve a covariance estimation problem in order to demonstrate its computational advantages. Numerical experiments on the four concrete applications are given to illustrate the theoretical and computational advances of the new methods compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.

66,"We prove that the extension complexity of the independence polytope of every regular matroid on 𝑛 elements is 𝑂(𝑛6). Past results of Wong and Martin on extended formulations of the spanning tree polytope of a graph imply a 𝑂(𝑛2) bound for the special case of (co)graphic matroids. However, the case of a general regular matroid was open, despite recent attempts. We also consider the extension complexity of circuit dominants of regular matroids, for which we give a 𝑂(𝑛2) bound.

67,"We study the value and the optimal strategies for a two-player zero-sum optimal stopping game with incomplete and asymmetric information. In our Bayesian setup, the drift of the underlying diffusion process is unknown to one player (incomplete information feature), but known to the other one (asymmetric information feature). We formulate the problem and reduce it to a fully Markovian setup where the uninformed player optimises over stopping times and the informed one uses randomised stopping times in order to hide their informational advantage. Then we provide a general verification result that allows us to find the value of the game and players’ optimal strategies by solving suitable quasi-variational inequalities with some nonstandard constraints. Finally, we study an example with linear payoffs, in which an explicit solution of the corresponding quasi-variational inequalities can be obtained.

68,"In a market that consists of multiple stocks and one risk-free asset whose mean return rates and volatility are deterministic, we study a continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection problem in which an agent is subject to a constraint that the expectation of the agent’s terminal wealth must exceed a target and minimize the variance of the agent’s terminal wealth. The agent can revise the expected terminal wealth target dynamically to adapt to the change of the agent’s current wealth, and we consider the following three targets: (i) the agent’s current wealth multiplied by a target expected gross return rate, (ii) the risk-free payoff of the agent’s current wealth plus a premium, and (iii) a weighted average of the risk-free payoff of the agent’s current wealth and a preset aspiration level. We derive the so-called equilibrium strategy in closed form for each of the three targets and find that the agent effectively minimizes the variance of the instantaneous change of the agent’s wealth subject to a certain constraint on the expectation of the instantaneous change of the agent’s wealth.

69,"Nonzero sum games typically have multiple Nash equilibriums (or no equilibrium), and unlike the zero-sum case, they may have different values at different equilibriums. Instead of focusing on the existence of individual equilibriums, we study the set of values over all equilibriums, which we call the set value of the game. The set value is unique by nature and always exists (with possible value ∅∅). Similar to the standard value function in control literature, it enjoys many nice properties, such as regularity, stability, and more importantly, the dynamic programming principle. There are two main features in order to obtain the dynamic programming principle: (i) we must use closed-loop controls (instead of open-loop controls); and (ii) we must allow for path dependent controls, even if the problem is in a state-dependent (Markovian) setting. We shall consider both discrete and continuous time models with finite time horizon. For the latter, we will also provide a duality approach through certain standard PDE (or path-dependent PDE), which is quite efficient for numerically computing the set value of the game.

70,"We present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for computing dd+o(d)𝑑𝑑+𝑜(𝑑)-approximate (pure) Nash equilibria in (proportional sharing) weighted congestion games with polynomial cost functions of degree at most d𝑑. This is an exponential improvement of the approximation factor with respect to the previously best deterministic algorithm. An appealing additional feature of the algorithm is that it only uses best-improvement steps in the actual game, as opposed to the previously best algorithms, that first had to transform the game itself. Our algorithm is an adaptation of the seminal algorithm by Caragiannis at al.

ACM Trans. Econom. Comput. 3(1):2:1–2:32.], but we utilize an approximate potential function directly on the original game instead of an exact one on a modified game. A critical component of our analysis, which is of independent interest, is the derivation of a novel bound of [d/W(d/ρ)]d+1[𝑑/𝒲(𝑑/𝜌)]𝑑+1 for the price of anarchy (PoA) of ρ𝜌-approximate equilibria in weighted congestion games, where W𝒲 is the Lambert-W function. More specifically, we show that this PoA is exactly equal to Φd+1d,ρ𝛷𝑑+1𝑑,𝜌, where Φd,ρ𝛷𝑑,𝜌 is the unique positive solution of the equation ρ(x+1)d=xd+1𝜌(𝑥+1)𝑑=𝑥𝑑+1. Our upper bound is derived via a smoothness-like argument, and thus holds even for mixed Nash and correlated equilibria, whereas our lower bound is simple enough to apply even to singleton congestion games.

72,"Classical theory for quasi-Newton schemes has focused on smooth, deterministic, unconstrained optimization, whereas recent forays into stochastic convex optimization have largely resided in smooth, unconstrained, and strongly convex regimes. Naturally, there is a compelling need to address nonsmoothness, the lack of strong convexity, and the presence of constraints. Accordingly, this paper presents a quasi-Newton framework that can process merely convex and possibly nonsmooth (but smoothable) stochastic convex problems. We propose a framework that combines iterative smoothing and regularization with a variance-reduced scheme reliant on using an increasing sample size of gradients. We make the following contributions. (i) We develop a regularized and smoothed variable sample-size BFGS update (rsL-BFGS) that generates a sequence of Hessian approximations and can accommodate nonsmooth convex objectives by utilizing iterative regularization and smoothing. (ii) In strongly convex regimes with state-dependent noise, the proposed variable sample-size stochastic quasi-Newton (VS-SQN) scheme admits a nonasymptotic linear rate of convergence, whereas the oracle complexity of computing an 𝜖-solution is 𝒪(𝜅𝑚+1/𝜖), where 𝜅 denotes the condition number and 𝑚≥1. In nonsmooth (but smoothable) regimes, using Moreau smoothing retains the linear convergence rate for the resulting smoothed VS-SQN (or sVS-SQN) scheme. Notably, the nonsmooth regime allows for accommodating convex constraints. To contend with the possible unavailability of Lipschitzian and strong convexity parameters, we also provide sublinear rates for diminishing step-length variants that do not rely on the knowledge of such parameters. (iii) In merely convex but smooth settings, the regularized VS-SQN scheme rVS-SQN displays a rate of 𝒪(1/𝑘(1−𝜖)) with an oracle complexity of 𝒪(1/𝜖3). When the smoothness requirements are weakened, the rate for the regularized and smoothed VS-SQN scheme rsVS-SQN worsens to 𝒪(𝑘−1/3). Such statements allow for a state-dependent noise assumption under a quadratic growth property on the objective. To the best of our knowledge, the rate results are among the first available rates for QN methods in nonsmooth regimes. Preliminary numerical evidence suggests that the schemes compare well with accelerated gradient counterparts on selected problems in stochastic optimization and machine learning with significant benefits in ill-conditioned regimes.

73,"Motivated by recent advances in solution methods for mixed-integer convex optimization (MICP), we study the fundamental and open question of which sets can be represented exactly as feasible regions of MICP problems. We establish several results in this direction, including the first complete characterization for the mixed-binary case and a simple necessary condition for the general case. We use the latter to derive the first nonrepresentability results for various nonconvex sets, such as the set of rank-1 matrices and the set of prime numbers. Finally, in correspondence with the seminal work on mixed-integer linear representability by Jeroslow and Lowe, we study the representability question under rationality assumptions. Under these rationality assumptions, we establish that representable sets obey strong regularity properties, such as periodicity, and we provide a complete characterization of representable subsets of the natural numbers and of representable compact sets. Interestingly, in the case of subsets of natural numbers, our results provide a clear separation between the mathematical modeling power of mixed-integer linear and mixed-integer convex optimization. In the case of compact sets, our results imply that using unbounded integer variables is necessary only for modeling unbounded sets.

75,"We develop a short-step interior point method to optimize a linear function over a convex body assuming that one only knows a membership oracle for this body. The approach is based a sketch of a universal interior point method using the so-called entropic barrier. It is well known that the gradient and Hessian of the entropic barrier can be approximated by sampling from Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions and the entropic barrier was shown to be self-concordant. The analysis of our algorithm uses properties of the entropic barrier, mixing times for hit-and-run random walks, approximation quality guarantees for the mean and covariance of a log-concave distribution, and results on inexact Newton-type methods.

76,"We develop algorithms solving parametric flow problems with separable, continuous, piecewise quadratic, and strictly convex cost functions. The parameter to be considered is a common multiplier on the demand of all nodes. Our algorithms compute a family of flows that are each feasible for the respective demand and minimize the costs among the feasible flows for that demand. For single commodity networks with homogenous cost functions, our algorithm requires one matrix multiplication for the initialization, a rank 1 update for each nondegenerate step and the solution of a convex quadratic program for each degenerate step. For nonhomogeneous cost functions, the initialization requires the solution of a convex quadratic program instead. For multi-commodity networks, both the initialization and every step of the algorithm require the solution of a convex program. As each step is mirrored by a breakpoint in the output this yields output-polynomial algorithms in every case.

77,"We study optimal design problems in which the goal is to choose a set of linear measurements to obtain the most accurate estimate of an unknown vector. We study the 𝐴-optimal design variant where the objective is to minimize the average variance of the error in the maximum likelihood estimate of the vector being measured. We introduce the proportional volume sampling algorithm to obtain nearly optimal bounds in the asymptotic regime when the number 𝑘 of measurements made is significantly larger than the dimension 𝑑 and obtain the first approximation algorithms whose approximation factor does not degrade with the number of possible measurements when 𝑘 is small. The algorithm also gives approximation guarantees for other optimal design objectives such as 𝐷-optimality and the generalized ratio objective, matching or improving the previously best-known results. We further show that bounds similar to ours cannot be obtained for 𝐸-optimal design and that 𝐴-optimal design is NP-hard to approximate within a fixed constant when 𝑘=𝑑.

78,"We provide prophet inequality algorithms for online weighted matching in general (nonbipartite) graphs, under two well-studied arrival models: edge arrival and vertex arrival. The weights of the edges are drawn from a priori known probability distribution. Under edge arrival, the weight of each edge is revealed on arrival, and the algorithm decides whether to include it in the matching or not. Under vertex arrival, the weights of all edges from the newly arriving vertex to all previously arrived vertices are revealed, and the algorithm decides which of these edges, if any, to include in the matching. To study these settings, we introduce a novel unified framework of batched-prophet inequalities that captures online settings where elements arrive in batches. Our algorithms rely on the construction of suitable online contention resolution scheme (OCRS). We first extend the framework of OCRS to batched-OCRS, we then establish a reduction from batched-prophet inequality to batched-OCRS, and finally we construct batched-OCRSs with selectable ratios of 0.337 and 0.5 for edge and vertex arrival models, respectively. Both results improve the state of the art for the corresponding settings. For vertex arrival, our result is tight. Interestingly, a pricing-based prophet inequality with comparable competitive ratios is unknown.

79,"In this paper, we present results on scalar risk measures in markets with transaction costs. Such risk measures are defined as the minimal capital requirements in the cash asset. First, some results are provided on the dual representation of such risk measures, with particular emphasis given on the space of dual variables as (equivalent) martingale measures and prices consistent with the market model. Then, these dual representations are used to obtain the main results of this paper on time consistency for scalar risk measures in markets with frictions. It is well known from the superhedging risk measure in markets with transaction costs that the usual scalar concept of time consistency is too strong and not satisfied. We will show that a weaker notion of time consistency can be defined, which corresponds to the usual scalar time consistency but under any fixed consistent pricing process. We will prove the equivalence of this weaker notion of time consistency and a certain type of backward recursion with respect to the underlying risk measure with a fixed consistent pricing process. Several examples are given, with special emphasis on the superhedging risk measure.

80,"We study the trade-off between the price of anarchy (PoA) and the price of stability (PoS) in mechanism design in the prototypical problem of unrelated machine scheduling. We give bounds on the space of feasible mechanisms with respect to these metrics and observe that two fundamental mechanisms, namely the first price (FP) and the second price (SP), lie on the two opposite extrema of this boundary. Furthermore, for the natural class of anonymous task-independent mechanisms, we completely characterize the PoA/PoS Pareto frontier; we design a class of optimal mechanisms 𝒮𝒫𝛼 that lie exactly on this frontier. In particular, these mechanisms range smoothly with respect to parameter 𝛼≥1 across the frontier, between the first price (𝒮𝒫1) and second price (𝒮𝒫∞) mechanisms. En route to these results, we also provide a definitive answer to an important question related to the scheduling problem, namely whether nontruthful mechanisms can provide better makespan guarantees in the equilibrium compared with truthful ones. We answer this question in the negative by proving that the price of anarchy of all scheduling mechanisms is at least n, where n is the number of machines.

81,"A single homogeneous resource needs to be fairly shared between users that dynamically arrive and depart over time. Although good allocations exist for any fixed number of users, implementing these allocations dynamically is impractical: it typically entails adjustments in the allocation of every user in the system whenever a new user arrives. We introduce a dynamic fair resource division problem in which there is a limit on the number of users that can be disrupted when a new user arrives and study the trade-off between fairness and the number of allowed disruptions, using a fairness metric: the fairness ratio. We almost completely characterize this trade-off and give an algorithm for obtaining the optimal fairness for any number of allowed disruptions.

82,"Stochastic point process models of event timing are common in many areas, including finance, insurance, and reliability. Monte Carlo simulation is often used to perform computations for these models. The standard sampling algorithm, which is based on a time-change argument, is widely applicable but generates biased simulation estimators. This article develops and analyzes a change of probability measure that can reduce or even eliminate the bias without restricting the scope of the algorithm. A result of independent interest offers new conditions that guarantee the existence of a broad class of point process martingales inducing changes of measure. Numerical results illustrate our approach.

84,"We study strategic games on weighted directed graphs, where each player’s payoff is defined as the sum of the weights on the edges from players who chose the same strategy, augmented by a fixed nonnegative integer bonus for picking a given strategy. These games capture the idea of coordination in the absence of globally common strategies. We identify natural classes of graphs for which finite improvement or coalition-improvement paths of polynomial length always exist, and consequently a (pure) Nash equilibrium or a strong equilibrium can be found in polynomial time. The considered classes of graphs are typical in network topologies: simple cycles correspond to the token ring local area networks, whereas open chains of simple cycles correspond to multiple independent rings topology from the recommendation G.8032v2 on Ethernet ring protection switching. For simple cycles, these results are optimal in the sense that without the imposed conditions on the weights and bonuses, a Nash equilibrium may not even exist. Finally, we prove that determining the existence of a Nash equilibrium or of a strong equilibrium is NP-complete already for unweighted graphs, with no bonuses assumed. This implies that the same problems for polymatrix games are strongly NP-hard.

85,"A min-max formula is proved for the minimum of an integer-valued separable discrete convex function in which the minimum is taken over the set of integral elements of a box total dual integral polyhedron. One variant of the theorem uses the notion of conjugate function (a fundamental concept in nonlinear optimization), but we also provide another version that avoids conjugates, and its spirit is conceptually closer to the standard form of classic min-max theorems in combinatorial optimization. The presented framework provides a unified background for separable convex minimization over the set of integral elements of the intersection of two integral base-polyhedra, submodular flows, L-convex sets, and polyhedra defined by totally unimodular matrices. As an unexpected application, we show how a wide class of inverse combinatorial optimization problems can be covered by this new framework.

86,"In this paper, we establish strong embedding theorems, in the sense of the Komlós-Major-Tusnády framework, for the performance metrics of a general class of transitory queueing models of nonstationary queueing systems. The nonstationary and non-Markovian nature of these models makes the computation of performance metrics hard. The strong embeddings yield error bounds on sample path approximations by diffusion processes in the form of functional strong approximation theorems.

87,"We propose a novel approach to monotone operator splitting based on the notion of a saddle operator. Under investigation is a highly structured multivariate monotone inclusion problem involving a mix of set-valued, cocoercive, and Lipschitzian monotone operators, as well as various monotonicity-preserving operations among them. This model encompasses most formulations found in the literature. A limitation of existing primal-dual algorithms is that they operate in a product space that is too small to achieve full splitting of our problem in the sense that each operator is used individually. To circumvent this difficulty, we recast the problem as that of finding a zero of a saddle operator that acts on a bigger space. This leads to an algorithm of unprecedented flexibility, which achieves full splitting, exploits the specific attributes of each operator, is asynchronous, and requires to activate only blocks of operators at each iteration, as opposed to activating all of them. The latter feature is of critical importance in large-scale problems. The weak convergence of the main algorithm is established, as well as the strong convergence of a variant. Various applications are discussed, and instantiations of the proposed framework in the context of variational inequalities and minimization problems are presented.

88,"In this paper, we introduce new relaxations for the hypograph of composite functions assuming that the outer function is supermodular and concave extendable. Relying on a recently introduced relaxation framework, we devise a separation algorithm for the graph of the outer function over P, where P is a special polytope to capture the structure of each inner function using its finitely many bounded estimators. The separation algorithm takes 𝒪(𝑑𝑛log𝑑) time, where d is the number of inner functions and n is the number of estimators for each inner function. Consequently, we derive large classes of inequalities that tighten prevalent factorable programming relaxations. We also generalize a decomposition result and devise techniques to simultaneously separate hypographs of various supermodular, concave-extendable functions using facet-defining inequalities. Assuming that the outer function is convex in each argument, we characterize the limiting relaxation obtained with infinitely many estimators as the solution of an optimal transport problem. When the outer function is also supermodular, we obtain an explicit integral formula for this relaxation.

89,"We develop a novel approximate simulation algorithm for the joint law of the position, the running supremum, and the time of the supremum of a general Lévy process at an arbitrary finite time. We identify the law of the error in simple terms. We prove that the error decays geometrically in Lp (for any 𝑝≥1) as a function of the computational cost, in contrast with the polynomial decay for the approximations available in the literature. We establish a central limit theorem and construct nonasymptotic and asymptotic confidence intervals for the corresponding Monte Carlo estimator. We prove that the multilevel Monte Carlo estimator has optimal computational complexity (i.e., of order ϵ−2 if the mean squared error is at most ϵ2) for locally Lipschitz and barrier-type functions of the triplet and develop an unbiased version of the estimator. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with numerical examples.

90,"The bilevel program is an optimization problem in which the constraint involves solutions to a parametric optimization problem. It is well known that the value function reformulation provides an equivalent single-level optimization problem, but it results in a nonsmooth optimization problem that never satisfies the usual constraint qualification, such as the Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ). In this paper, we show that even the first order sufficient condition for metric subregularity (which is, in general, weaker than MFCQ) fails at each feasible point of the bilevel program. We introduce the concept of a directional calmness condition and show that, under the directional calmness condition, the directional necessary optimality condition holds. Although the directional optimality condition is, in general, sharper than the nondirectional one, the directional calmness condition is, in general, weaker than the classical calmness condition and, hence, is more likely to hold. We perform the directional sensitivity analysis of the value function and propose the directional quasi-normality as a sufficient condition for the directional calmness. An example is given to show that the directional quasi-normality condition may hold for the bilevel program.

91,"We describe a fluid model with time-varying input that approximates a multiclass many-server queue with general reneging distribution and multiple customer classes (specifically, the multiclass G/GI/N+GI queue). The system dynamics depend on the policy, which is a rule for determining when to serve a given customer class. The class of admissible control policies are those that are head-of-the-line (HL) and nonanticipating. For a sequence of many-server queues operating under admissible HL control policies and satisfying some mild asymptotic conditions, we establish a tightness result for the sequence of fluid scaled queue state descriptors and associated processes and show that limit points of such sequences are fluid model solutions almost surely. The tightness result together with the characterization of distributional limit points as fluid model solutions almost surely provides a foundation for the analysis of particular HL control policies of interest. We leverage these results to analyze a set of admissible HL control policies that we introduce, called weighted random buffer selection (WRBS), and an associated WRBS fluid model that allows multiple classes to be partially served in the fluid limit (which is in contrast to previously analyzed static priority policies).

92,"We propose a new augmented Lagrangian (AL) method for solving the mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC), where the complementarity constraints are left out of the AL function and treated directly. Two observations motivate us to propose this method: The AL subproblems are closer to the original problem in terms of the constraint structure; and the AL subproblems can be solved efficiently by a nonmonotone projected gradient method, in which we have closed-form solutions at each iteration. The former property helps us show that the proposed method converges globally to an M-stationary (better than C-stationary) point under MPCC relaxed constant positive linear dependence condition. Theoretical comparison with existing AL methods demonstrates that the proposed method is superior in terms of the quality of accumulation points and the strength of assumptions.

93,"We study multiplayer stochastic multiarmed bandit problems in which the players cannot communicate, and if two or more players pull the same arm, a collision occurs and the involved players receive zero reward. We consider two feedback models: a model in which the players can observe whether a collision has occurred and a more difficult setup in which no collision information is available. We give the first theoretical guarantees for the second model: an algorithm with a logarithmic regret and an algorithm with a square-root regret that does not depend on the gaps between the means. For the first model, we give the first square-root regret bounds that do not depend on the gaps. Building on these ideas, we also give an algorithm for reaching approximate Nash equilibria quickly in stochastic anticoordination games.

94,"One of the basic facts known for discrete-time Markov decision processes is that, if the probability distribution of an initial state is fixed, then for every policy it is easy to construct a (randomized) Markov policy with the same marginal distributions of state-action pairs as for the original policy. This equality of marginal distributions implies that the values of major objective criteria, including expected discounted total costs and average rewards per unit time, are equal for these two policies. This paper investigates the validity of the similar fact for continuous-time jump Markov decision processes (CTJMDPs). It is shown in this paper that the equality of marginal distributions takes place for a CTJMDP if the corresponding Markov policy defines a nonexplosive jump Markov process. If this Markov process is explosive, then at each time instance, the marginal probability, that a state-action pair belongs to a measurable set of state-action pairs, is not greater for the described Markov policy than the same probability for the original policy. These results are applied in this paper to CTJMDPs with expected discounted total costs and average costs per unit time. It is shown for these criteria that, if the initial state distribution is fixed, then for every policy, there exists a Markov policy with the same or better value of the objective function.

95,"A central object of study in optimal stopping theory is the single-choice prophet inequality for independent and identically distributed random variables: given a sequence of random variables X1,…,Xn𝑋1,…,𝑋𝑛 drawn independently from the same distribution, the goal is to choose a stopping time τ such that for the maximum value of α and for all distributions, E[Xτ]≥α·E[max tXt]𝔼[𝑋𝜏]≥𝛼·𝔼[max𝑡𝑋𝑡]. What makes this problem challenging is that the decision whether τ=t𝜏=𝑡 may only depend on the values of the random variables X1,…,Xt𝑋1,…,𝑋𝑡 and on the distribution F. For a long time, the best known bound for the problem had been α≥1−1/e≈0.632𝛼≥1−1/𝑒≈0.632, but recently a tight bound of α≈0.745 was obtained. The case where F is unknown, such that the decision whether τ=t may depend only on the values of the random variables X1,…,Xt, is equally well motivated but has received much less attention. A straightforward guarantee for this case of α≥1/e≈0.368 can be derived from the well-known optimal solution to the secretary problem, where an arbitrary set of values arrive in random order and the goal is to maximize the probability of selecting the largest value. We show that this bound is in fact tight. We then investigate the case where the stopping time may additionally depend on a limited number of samples from F, and we show that, even with o(n) samples, α≤1/e. On the other hand, n samples allow for a significant improvement, whereas O(n2) samples are equivalent to knowledge of the distribution: specifically, with n samples, α≥1−1/e≈0.632 and α≤ln (2)≈0.693, and with O(n2) samples, α≥0.745−ε for any ε>0.

96,"A fork-join processing network is a queueing network in which tasks associated with a job can be processed simultaneously. Fork-join processing networks are prevalent in computer systems, healthcare, manufacturing, project management, justice systems, and so on. Unlike the conventional queueing networks, fork-join processing networks have synchronization constraints that arise because of the parallel processing of tasks and can cause significant job delays. We study scheduling in fork-join processing networks with multiple job types and parallel shared resources. Jobs arriving in the system fork into arbitrary number of tasks, then those tasks are processed in parallel, and then they join and leave the network. There are shared resources processing multiple job types. We study the scheduling problem for those shared resources (i.e., which type of job to prioritize at any given time) and propose an asymptotically optimal scheduling policy in diffusion scale.

98,"We propose subsampling as a unified algorithmic technique for submodular maximization in centralized and online settings. The idea is simple: independently sample elements from the ground set and use simple combinatorial techniques (such as greedy or local search) on these sampled elements. We show that this approach leads to optimal/state-of-the-art results despite being much simpler than existing methods. In the usual off-line setting, we present SampleGreedy, which obtains a (𝑝+2+𝑜(1))-approximation for maximizing a submodular function subject to a p-extendible system using 𝑂(𝑛+𝑛𝑘/𝑝) evaluation and feasibility queries, where k is the size of the largest feasible set. The approximation ratio improves to p + 1 and p for monotone submodular and linear objectives, respectively. In the streaming setting, we present Sample-Streaming, which obtains a (4𝑝+2−𝑜(1))-approximation for maximizing a submodular function subject to a p-matchoid using O(k) memory and 𝑂(𝑘𝑚/𝑝) evaluation and feasibility queries per element, and m is the number of matroids defining the p-matchoid. The approximation ratio improves to 4p for monotone submodular objectives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on video summarization, location summarization, and movie recommendation tasks.

99,"Dynamic network flows, or network flows over time, constitute an important model for real-world situations in which steady states are unusual, such as urban traffic and the internet. These applications immediately raise the issue of analyzing dynamic network flows from a game-theoretic perspective. In this paper, we study dynamic equilibria in the deterministic fluid queuing model in single-source, single-sink networks—arguably the most basic model for flows over time. In the last decade, we have witnessed significant developments in the theoretical understanding of the model. However, several fundamental questions remain open. One of the most prominent ones concerns the price of anarchy, measured as the worst-case ratio between the minimum time required to route a given amount of flow from the source to the sink and the time a dynamic equilibrium takes to perform the same task. Our main result states that, if we could reduce the inflow of the network in a dynamic equilibrium, then the price of anarchy is bounded by a factor, parameterized by the longest path length that converges to e/(e−1), and this is tight. This significantly extends a result by Bhaskar et al. (SODA 2011). Furthermore, our methods allow us to determine that the price of anarchy in parallel-link and parallel-path networks is exactly 4/3. Finally, we argue that, if a certain, very natural, monotonicity conjecture holds, the price of anarchy in the general case is exactly e/(e−1).

100,"We introduce threshold growth in the classical threshold contagion model, or equivalently a network of Cramér-Lundberg processes in which nodes have downward jumps when there is a failure of a neighboring node. Choosing the configuration model as underlying graph, we prove fluid limits for the baseline model, as well as extensions to the directed case, state-dependent interarrival times and the case of growth driven by upward jumps. We obtain explicit ruin probabilities for the nodes according to their characteristics: initial threshold and in- (and out-) degree. We then allow nodes to choose their connectivity by trading off link benefits and contagion risk. We define a rational equilibrium concept in which nodes choose their connectivity according to an expected failure probability of any given link and then impose condition that the expected failure probability coincides with the actual failure probability under the optimal connectivity. We show existence of an asymptotic equilibrium and convergence of the sequence of equilibria on the finite networks. In particular, our results show that systems with higher overall growth may have higher failure probability in equilibrium.

101,"We develop stochastic first-order primal-dual algorithms to solve a class of convex-concave saddle-point problems. When the saddle function is strongly convex in the primal variable, we develop the first stochastic restart scheme for this problem. When the gradient noises obey sub-Gaussian distributions, the oracle complexity of our restart scheme is strictly better than any of the existing methods, even in the deterministic case. Furthermore, for each problem parameter of interest, whenever the lower bound exists, the oracle complexity of our restart scheme is either optimal or nearly optimal (up to a log factor). The subroutine used in this scheme is itself a new stochastic algorithm developed for the problem where the saddle function is nonstrongly convex in the primal variable. This new algorithm, which is based on the primal-dual hybrid gradient framework, achieves the state-of-the-art oracle complexity and may be of independent interest.

102,"We consider the linear programming approach for constrained and unconstrained Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the long-run average-cost criterion, where the class of MDPs in our study have Borel state spaces and discrete countable action spaces. Under a strict unboundedness condition on the one-stage costs and a recently introduced majorization condition on the state transition stochastic kernel, we study infinite-dimensional linear programs for the average-cost MDPs and prove the absence of a duality gap and other optimality results. Our results do not require a lower-semicontinuous MDP model. Thus, they can be applied to countable action space MDPs where the dynamics and one-stage costs are discontinuous in the state variable. Our proofs make use of the continuity property of Borel measurable functions asserted by Lusin’s theorem.

103,"We consider optimal transport-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems with locally strongly convex transport cost functions and affine decision rules. Under conventional convexity assumptions on the underlying loss function, we obtain structural results about the value function, the optimal policy, and the worst-case optimal transport adversarial model. These results expose a rich structure embedded in the DRO problem (e.g., strong convexity even if the non-DRO problem is not strongly convex, a suitable scaling of the Lagrangian for the DRO constraint, etc., which are crucial for the design of efficient algorithms). As a consequence of these results, one can develop efficient optimization procedures that have the same sample and iteration complexity as a natural non-DRO benchmark algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent.

104,"We study a class of linear-quadratic stochastic differential games in which each player interacts directly only with its nearest neighbors in a given graph. We find a semiexplicit Markovian equilibrium for any transitive graph, in terms of the empirical eigenvalue distribution of the graph’s normalized Laplacian matrix. This facilitates large-population asymptotics for various graph sequences, with several sparse and dense examples discussed in detail. In particular, the mean field game is the correct limit only in the dense graph case, that is, when the degrees diverge in a suitable sense. Although equilibrium strategies are nonlocal, depending on the behavior of all players, we use a correlation decay estimate to prove a propagation of chaos result in both the dense and sparse regimes, with the sparse case owing to the large distances between typical vertices. Without assuming the graphs are transitive, we show also that the mean field game solution can be used to construct decentralized approximate equilibria on any sufficiently dense graph sequence.

105,"In this paper, we consider a problem of minimizing an M-convex function under an L1-distance constraint (MML1); the constraint is given by an upper bound for L1-distance between a feasible solution and a given “center.” This is motivated by a nonlinear integer programming problem for reallocation of dock capacity in a bike-sharing system discussed by Freund et al. (2017). The main aim of this paper is to better understand the combinatorial structure of the dock reallocation problem through the connection with M-convexity and show its polynomial-time solvability using this connection. For this, we first show that the dock reallocation problem and its generalizations can be reformulated in the form of (MML1). We then present a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for (MML1) based on the steepest descent approach. We also propose two polynomial-time algorithms for (MML1) by replacing the L1-distance constraint with a simple linear constraint. Finally, we apply the results for (MML1) to the dock reallocation problem to obtain a pseudo-polynomial-time steepest descent algorithm and also polynomial-time algorithms for this problem. For this purpose, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm for a relaxation of the dock reallocation problem by using a proximity-scaling approach, which is of interest in its own right.

106,"We consider the following general network design problem. The input is an asymmetric metric (V, c), root r∈V𝑟∈𝑉, monotone submodular function f:2V→R+𝑓:2𝑉→ℝ+, and budget B. The goal is to find an r-rooted arborescence T of cost at most B that maximizes f(T). Our main result is a simple quasi-polynomial time O(logkloglogk)𝑂(log𝑘loglog𝑘)-approximation algorithm for this problem, in which k≤|V|𝑘≤|𝑉| is the number of vertices in an optimal solution. As a consequence, we obtain an O(log2kloglogk)𝑂(log2𝑘loglog𝑘)-approximation algorithm for directed (polymatroid) Steiner tree in quasi-polynomial time. We also extend our main result to a setting with additional length bounds at vertices, which leads to improved O(log2kloglogk)𝑂(log2𝑘loglog𝑘)-approximation algorithms for the single-source buy-at-bulk and priority Steiner tree problems. For the usual directed Steiner tree problem, our result matches the best previous approximation ratio but improves significantly on the running time. For polymatroid Steiner tree and single-source buy-at-bulk, our result improves prior approximation ratios by a logarithmic factor. For directed priority Steiner tree, our result seems to be the first nontrivial approximation ratio. Under certain complexity assumptions, our approximation ratios are the best possible (up to constant factors).

107,"This paper defines a general framework to study infinitely repeated games with time-dependent discounting in which we distinguish and discuss both time-consistent and -inconsistent preferences. To study the long-term properties of repeated games, we introduce an asymptotic condition to characterize the fact that players become more and more patient; that is, the discount factors at all stages uniformly converge to one. Two types of folk theorems are proven without the public randomization assumption: the asymptotic one, that is, the equilibrium payoff set converges to the feasible and individual rational set as players become patient, and the uniform one, that is, any payoff in the feasible and individual rational set is sustained by a single strategy profile that is an approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in all games with sufficiently patient discount factors. We use two methods for the study of asymptotic folk theorem: the self-generating approach and the constructive proof. We present the constructive proof in the perfect-monitoring case and show that it can be extended to time-inconsistent preferences. The self-generating approach applies to the public-monitoring case but may not extend to time-inconsistent preferences because of a nonmonotonicity result.

108,"This paper proposes a simple descriptive model of discrete-time double auction markets for divisible assets. As in the classical models of exchange economies, we consider a finite set of agents described by their initial endowments and preferences. Instead of the classical Walrasian-type market models, however, we assume that all trades take place in a centralized double auction where the agents communicate through sealed limit orders for buying and selling. We find that, under nonstrategic bidding, double auction clears with zero trades precisely when the agents’ current holdings are on the Pareto frontier. More interestingly, the double auctions implement Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” in the sense that, when starting from disequilibrium, repeated double auctions lead to a sequence of allocations that converges to individually rational Pareto allocations.

110,"Predictive analytics, empowered by machine learning, is usually followed by decision-making problems in prescriptive analytics. We extend the previous sequential prediction-optimization paradigm to a coupled scheme such that the prediction model can guide the decision problem to produce coordinated decisions yielding higher levels of performance. Specifically, for stochastic programming (SP) models with latently decision-dependent uncertainty, without any parametric assumption of the latent dependency, we develop a coupled learning enabled optimization (CLEO) algorithm in which the learning step of predicting the local dependency and the optimization step of computing a candidate decision are conducted interactively. The CLEO algorithm automatically balances the exploration and exploitation via the trust region method with active sampling. Under certain assumptions, we show that the sequence of solutions provided by CLEO converges to a directional stationary point of the original nonconvex and nonsmooth SP problem with probability 1. In addition, we present preliminary experimental results which demonstrate the computational potential of this data-driven approach.

112,"We consider two classes of games in which players are the vertices of a directed graph. Initially, nature chooses one player according to some fixed distribution and gives the player a buck. This player passes the buck to one of the player’s out-neighbors in the graph. The procedure is repeated indefinitely. In one class of games, each player wants to minimize the asymptotic expected frequency of times that the player receives the buck. In the other class of games, the player wants to maximize it. The PageRank game is a particular case of these maximizing games. We consider deterministic and stochastic versions of the game, depending on how players select the neighbor to which to pass the buck. In both cases, we prove the existence of pure equilibria that do not depend on the initial distribution; this is achieved by showing the existence of a generalized ordinal potential. If the graph on which the game is played admits a Hamiltonian cycle, then this is the outcome of prior-free Nash equilibrium in the minimizing game. For the minimizing game, we then use the price of anarchy and stability to measure fairness of these equilibria.

113,"We consider robust Markov decision processes with Borel state and action spaces, unbounded cost, and finite time horizon. Our formulation leads to a Stackelberg game against nature. Under integrability, continuity, and compactness assumptions, we derive a robust cost iteration for a fixed policy of the decision maker and a value iteration for the robust optimization problem. Moreover, we show the existence of deterministic optimal policies for both players. This is in contrast to classical zero-sum games. In case the state space is the real line, we show under some convexity assumptions that the interchange of supremum and infimum is possible with the help of Sion’s minimax theorem. Further, we consider the problem with special ambiguity sets. In particular, we are able to derive some cases where the robust optimization problem coincides with the minimization of a coherent risk measure. In the final section, we discuss two applications: a robust linear-quadratic problem and a robust problem for managing regenerative energy.

114,"We undertake a fundamental study of network equilibria modeled as solutions of fixed-point equations for monotone linear functions with saturation nonlinearities. The considered model extends one originally proposed to study systemic risk in networks of financial institutions interconnected by mutual obligations. It is one of the simplest continuous models accounting for shock propagation phenomena and cascading failure effects. This model also characterizes Nash equilibria of constrained quadratic network games with strategic complementarities. We first derive explicit expressions for network equilibria and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for their uniqueness, encompassing and generalizing results available in the literature. Then, we study jump discontinuities of the network equilibria when the exogenous flows cross certain regions of measure 0 representable as graphs of continuous functions. Finally, we discuss some implications of our results in the two main motivating applications. In financial networks, this bifurcation phenomenon is responsible for how small shocks in the assets of a few nodes can trigger major aggregate losses to the system and cause the default of several agents. In constrained quadratic network games, it induces a blow-up behavior of the sensitivity of Nash equilibria with respect to the individual benefits.

115,"The optimal retirement decision is an optimal stopping problem when retirement is irreversible. We investigate the optimal consumption, investment, and retirement decisions when the mean return of a risky asset is unobservable and is estimated by filtering from historical prices. To ensure nonnegativity of the consumption rate and the borrowing constraints on the wealth process of the representative agent, we conduct our analysis using a duality approach. We link the dual problem to American option pricing with stochastic volatility and prove that the duality gap is closed. We then apply our theory to a hidden Markov model for regime-switching mean return with Bayesian learning. We fully characterize the existence and uniqueness of variational inequality in the dual optimal stopping problem, as well as the free boundary of the problem. An asymptotic closed-form solution is derived for optimal retirement timing by small-scale perturbation. We discuss the potential applications of the results to other partial-information settings.

116,"In this paper, we introduce and solve a class of optimal stopping problems of recursive type. In particular, the stopping payoff depends directly on the value function of the problem itself. In a multidimensional Markovian setting, we show that the problem is well posed in the sense that the value is indeed the unique solution to a fixed point problem in a suitable space of continuous functions, and an optimal stopping time exists. We then apply our class of problems to a model for stock trading in two different market venues, and we determine the optimal stopping rule in that case.

117,"We consider a heterogeneous distributed service system consisting of n servers with unknown and possibly different processing rates. Jobs with unit mean arrive as a renewal process of rate proportional to n and are immediately dispatched to one of several queues associated with the servers. We assume that the dispatching decisions are made by a central dispatcher with the ability to exchange messages with the servers and endowed with a finite memory used to store information from one decision epoch to the next, about the current state of the queues and about the service rates of the servers. We study the fundamental resource requirements (memory bits and message exchange rate) in order for a dispatching policy to be always stable. First, we present a policy that is always stable while using a positive (but arbitrarily small) message rate and log2(𝑛) bits of memory. Second, we show that within a certain broad class of policies, a dispatching policy that exchanges 𝑜(𝑛2) messages per unit of time, and with 𝑜(log(𝑛)) bits of memory, cannot be always stable.

118,"This work develops algorithmic results for the classic cake-cutting problem in which a divisible, heterogeneous resource (modeled as a cake) needs to be partitioned among agents with distinct preferences. We focus on a standard formulation of cake cutting wherein each agent must receive a contiguous piece of the cake. Although multiple hardness results exist in this setup for finding fair/efficient cake divisions, we show that, if the value densities of the agents satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP), then strong algorithmic results hold for various notions of fairness and economic efficiency. Addressing cake-cutting instances with MLRP, first we develop an algorithm that finds cake divisions (with connected pieces) that are envy free, up to an arbitrary precision. The time complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of agents and the bit complexity of an underlying Lipschitz constant. We obtain similar positive results for maximizing social, egalitarian, and Nash social welfare. Many distribution families bear MLRP. In particular, this property holds if all the value densities belong to any one of the following families: Gaussian (with the same variance), linear, Poisson, and exponential distributions, linear translations of any log-concave function. Hence, through MLRP, the current work obtains novel cake-cutting algorithms for multiple distribution families.

119,"We consider the general (stochastic) contextual bandit problem under the realizability assumption, that is, the expected reward, as a function of contexts and actions, belongs to a general function class ℱ. We design a fast and simple algorithm that achieves the statistically optimal regret with only 𝑂(log𝑇) calls to an offline regression oracle across all T rounds. The number of oracle calls can be further reduced to 𝑂(loglog𝑇) if T is known in advance. Our results provide the first universal and optimal reduction from contextual bandits to offline regression, solving an important open problem in the contextual bandit literature. A direct consequence of our results is that any advances in offline regression immediately translate to contextual bandits, statistically and computationally. This leads to faster algorithms and improved regret guarantees for broader classes of contextual bandit problems.

120,"In this paper, we consider a well-known sparse optimization problem that aims to find a sparse solution of a possibly noisy underdetermined system of linear equations. Mathematically, it can be modeled in a unified manner by minimizing ||x||pp∣∣∣∣𝑥∣∣∣∣𝑝𝑝 subject to ||Ax−b‖q≤σ∣∣∣∣𝐴𝑥−𝑏‖𝑞≤𝜎 for given A∈Rm×n, b∈Rm, σ≥0, 0≤p≤1𝐴∈ℝ𝑚×𝑛,𝑏∈ℝ𝑚,𝜎≥0,0≤𝑝≤1 and q≥1. We then study various properties of the optimal solutions of this problem. Specifically, without any condition on the matrix A, we provide upper bounds in cardinality and infinity norm for the optimal solutions and show that all optimal solutions must be on the boundary of the feasible set when 0<p≤1. Moreover, for q∈{1,∞}, we show that the problem with 0<p<1 has a finite number of optimal solutions and prove that there exists 0<p*<1 such that the solution set of the problem with any 0<p<p* is contained in the solution set of the problem with p = 0, and there further exists 0<ˉp<p* such that the solution set of the problem with any 0<p≤ˉp remains unchanged. An estimation of such p* is also provided. In addition, to solve the constrained nonconvex non-Lipschitz Lp-L1 problem (0<p<1 and q = 1), we propose a smoothing penalty method and show that, under some mild conditions, any cluster point of the sequence generated is a stationary point of our problem. Some numerical examples are given to implicitly illustrate the theoretical results and show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for the constrained Lp-L1 problem under different noises.

121,"Suppose the consumption space is discrete. Our first contribution is a technical result showing that any continuous utility function of any stationary preference relation over infinite consumption streams has convex range, provided that the agent is sufficiently patient. Putting the result to use, we consider a model of endogenous discounting (a generalization of the standard model with geometric discounting) and show the uniqueness of the consumption-dependent discount factor as well as the cardinal uniqueness of utility. Comparative statics are then provided to substantiate the uniqueness. For instance, we show that, as in the more familiar case of an infinitely divisible good, the cardinal uniqueness of utility captures an agent’s desire to smooth consumption over time.

122,"We study the problem of fair rent division that entails splitting the rent and allocating the rooms of an apartment among agents in a fair manner (i.e., under the imposed rents, no agent has a strictly stronger preference for any other agent’s room). The utility functions specify the cardinal preferences of the agents for the rooms for every possible room rent. Although envy-free solutions are guaranteed to exist under reasonably general utility functions, efficient algorithms for finding them were known only for quasilinear utilities. This work addresses this notable gap and develops a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for fair rent division with minimal assumptions on the utility functions. Envy-free solutions correspond to equilibria of a two-sided matching market with monetary transfers; hence, this work also provides efficient algorithms for finding approximate equilibria in such markets. We complement the algorithmic results by proving that the fair rent division problem lies in the intersection of the complexity classes polynomial parity arguments on directed graphs and polynomial local search.

123,"We analyze a firm’s optimal pricing of a new service when consumers interact in a network and impose positive externality on one another. The firm initially provides its service for free, leveraging network externality to promote rapid service consumption growth. The firm raises the price and starts earning revenue only when a sufficient level of consumer interactions is established. Incorporating the local network effects in a nonstationary dynamic model, we study the impact of network structure on the firm’s revenue and optimal pricing decision. We find that the firm delays the timing of service monetization when it faces a more strongly connected network despite the fact that such a network allows the firm to monetize the service sooner by resulting in faster consumption growth. We also find that the firm benefits from network imbalance; that is, the firm prefers a network of consumers with varying degrees of connections to that with similar degrees of connections. We also study the value of knowing the network structure and discuss how such knowledge impacts the firm’s profitability. Our analyses rely on the techniques from algebraic graph theory, which enable us to solve the firm’s high-dimensional dynamic pricing problem by relating it to the network’s spectral characteristics.

124,"This paper has two main goals: (a) establish several statistical properties—consistency, asymptotic distributions, and convergence rates—of stationary solutions and values of a class of coupled nonconvex and nonsmooth empirical risk-minimization problems and (b) validate these properties by a noisy amplitude-based phase-retrieval problem, the latter being of much topical interest. Derived from available data via sampling, these empirical risk-minimization problems are the computational workhorse of a population risk model that involves the minimization of an expected value of a random functional. When these minimization problems are nonconvex, the computation of their globally optimal solutions is elusive. Together with the fact that the expectation operator cannot be evaluated for general probability distributions, it becomes necessary to justify whether the stationary solutions of the empirical problems are practical approximations of the stationary solution of the population problem. When these two features, general distribution and nonconvexity, are coupled with nondifferentiability that often renders the problems “non-Clarke regular,” the task of the justification becomes challenging. Our work aims to address such a challenge within an algorithm-free setting. The resulting analysis is, therefore, different from much of the analysis in the recent literature that is based on local search algorithms. Furthermore, supplementing the classical global minimizer-centric analysis, our results offer a promising step to close the gap between computational optimization and asymptotic analysis of coupled, nonconvex, nonsmooth statistical estimation problems, expanding the former with statistical properties of the practically obtained solution and providing the latter with a more practical focus pertaining to computational tractability.

126,"The recent surge of breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence has sparked renewed interest in large-scale stochastic optimization problems that are universally considered hard. One of the most widely used methods for solving such problems is distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (DASGD), a family of algorithms that result from parallelizing stochastic gradient descent on distributed computing architectures (possibly) asychronously. However, a key obstacle in the efficient implementation of DASGD is the issue of delays: when a computing node contributes a gradient update, the global model parameter may have already been updated by other nodes several times over, thereby rendering this gradient information stale. These delays can quickly add up if the computational throughput of a node is saturated, so the convergence of DASGD may be compromised in the presence of large delays. Our first contribution is that, by carefully tuning the algorithm’s step size, convergence to the critical set is still achieved in mean square, even if the delays grow unbounded at a polynomial rate. We also establish finer results in a broad class of structured optimization problems (called variationally coherent), where we show that DASGD converges to a global optimum with a probability of one under the same delay assumptions. Together, these results contribute to the broad landscape of large-scale nonconvex stochastic optimization by offering state-of-the-art theoretical guarantees and providing insights for algorithm design.

127,"Demand response programs in retail electricity markets are very popular. However, despite their success in reducing average consumption, the random responsiveness of consumers to price events makes their efficiency questionable to achieve the flexibility needed for electric systems with a large share of renewable energy. This paper aims at designing demand response contracts that allow to act on both the average consumption and its variance. The interaction between a risk-averse producer and a risk-averse consumer is modelled as a principal–agent problem, thus accounting for the moral hazard underlying demand response contracts. The producer, facing the limited flexibility of production, pays an appropriate incentive compensation to encourage the consumer to reduce his average consumption and to enhance his responsiveness. We provide a closed-form solution for the optimal contract in the linear case. We show that the optimal contract has a rebate form where the initial condition of the consumption serves as a baseline and where the consumer is charged a price for energy and a price for volatility. The first-best price for energy is a convex combination of the marginal cost and the marginal value of energy, where the weights are given by the risk-aversion ratios, and the first-best price for volatility is the risk-aversion ratio times the marginal cost of volatility. The second-best price, for energy and volatility, is a decreasing nonlinear function of time inducing decreasing effort. The price for energy is lower (respectively, higher) than the marginal cost of energy during peak-load (respectively, off-peak) periods. We illustrate the potential benefits issued from the implementation of an incentive mechanism on the responsiveness of the consumer by calibrating our model with publicly available data.

128,"In this paper, we consider the stochastic iterative counterpart of the value iteration scheme wherein only noisy and possibly biased approximations of the Bellman operator are available. We call this counterpart the approximate value iteration (AVI) scheme. Neural networks are often used as function approximators, in order to counter Bellman’s curse of dimensionality. In this paper, they are used to approximate the Bellman operator. Because neural networks are typically trained using sample data, errors and biases may be introduced. The design of AVI accounts for implementations with biased approximations of the Bellman operator and sampling errors. We present verifiable sufficient conditions under which AVI is stable (almost surely bounded) and converges to a fixed point of the approximate Bellman operator. To ensure the stability of AVI, we present three different yet related sets of sufficient conditions that are based on the existence of an appropriate Lyapunov function. These Lyapunov function–based conditions are easily verifiable and new to the literature. The verifiability is enhanced by the fact that a recipe for the construction of the necessary Lyapunov function is also provided. We also show that the stability analysis of AVI can be readily extended to the general case of set-valued stochastic approximations. Finally, we show that AVI can also be used in more general circumstances, that is, for finding fixed points of contractive set-valued maps.

129,"Sequential optimality conditions play a major role in proving stronger global convergence results of numerical algorithms for nonlinear programming. Several extensions are described in conic contexts, in which many open questions have arisen. In this paper, we present new sequential optimality conditions in the context of a general nonlinear conic framework, which explains and improves several known results for specific cases, such as semidefinite programming, second-order cone programming, and nonlinear programming. In particular, we show that feasible limit points of sequences generated by the augmented Lagrangian method satisfy the so-called approximate gradient projection optimality condition and, under an additional smoothness assumption, the so-called complementary approximate Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition. The first result was unknown even for nonlinear programming, and the second one was unknown, for instance, for semidefinite programming.

130,"We consider the problem of adversarial (nonstochastic) online learning with partial-information feedback, in which, at each round, a decision maker selects an action from a finite set of alternatives. We develop a black-box approach for such problems in which the learner observes as feedback only losses of a subset of the actions that includes the selected action. When losses of actions are nonnegative, under the graph-based feedback model introduced by Mannor and Shamir, we offer algorithms that attain the so called “small-loss” 𝑜(𝛼𝐿⋆) regret bounds with high probability, where α is the independence number of the graph and 𝐿⋆ is the loss of the best action. Prior to our work, there was no data-dependent guarantee for general feedback graphs even for pseudo-regret (without dependence on the number of actions, i.e., utilizing the increased information feedback). Taking advantage of the black-box nature of our technique, we extend our results to many other applications, such as combinatorial semi-bandits (including routing in networks), contextual bandits (even with an infinite comparator class), and learning with slowly changing (shifting) comparators. In the special case of multi-armed bandit and combinatorial semi-bandit problems, we provide optimal small-loss, high-probability regret guarantees of 𝒪˜(𝑑𝐿⋆‾‾‾‾√), where d is the number of actions, answering open questions of Neu. Previous bounds for multi-armed bandits and semi-bandits were known only for pseudo-regret and only in expectation. We also offer an optimal 𝒪˜(𝜅𝐿⋆‾‾‾‾√) regret guarantee for fixed feedback graphs with clique-partition number at most κ.

131,"The doubly nonnegative (DNN) cone, being the set of all positive semidefinite matrices whose elements are nonnegative, is a popular approximation of the computationally intractable completely positive cone. The major difficulty for implementing a Newton-type method to compute the projection of a given large-scale matrix onto the DNN cone lies in the possible failure of the constraint nondegeneracy, a generalization of the linear independence constraint qualification for nonlinear programming. Such a failure results in the singularity of the Jacobian of the nonsmooth equation representing the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality condition that prevents the semismooth Newton–conjugate gradient method from solving it with a desirable convergence rate. In this paper, we overcome the aforementioned difficulty by solving a sequence of better conditioned nonsmooth equations generated by the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) instead of solving one aforementioned singular equation. By leveraging the metric subregularity of the normal cone associated with the positive semidefinite cone, we derive sufficient conditions to ensure the dual quadratic growth condition of the underlying problem, which further leads to the asymptotically superlinear convergence of the proposed ALM. Numerical results on difficult randomly generated instances and from the semidefinite programming library are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm for computing the DNN projection to a very high accuracy.

133,"In this paper, we consider a class of structured nonsmooth difference-of-convex (DC) constrained DC programs in which the first convex component of the objective and constraints is the sum of a smooth and a nonsmooth function, and their second convex component is the supremum of finitely many convex smooth functions. The existing methods for this problem usually have a weak convergence guarantee or require a feasible initial point. Inspired by the recent work by Pang et al. [Pang J-S, Razaviyayn M, Alvarado A (2017) Computing B-stationary points of nonsmooth DC programs. Math. Oper. Res. 42(1):95–118.], in this paper, we propose two infeasible methods with a strong convergence guarantee for the considered problem. The first one is a penalty method that consists of finding an approximate D-stationary point of a sequence of penalty subproblems. We show that any feasible accumulation point of the solution sequence generated by such a penalty method is a B-stationary point of the problem under a weakest possible assumption that it satisfies a pointwise Slater constraint qualification (PSCQ). The second one is an augmented Lagrangian (AL) method that consists of finding an approximate D-stationary point of a sequence of AL subproblems. Under the same PSCQ condition as for the penalty method, we show that any feasible accumulation point of the solution sequence generated by such an AL method is a B-stationary point of the problem, and moreover, it satisfies a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker type of optimality condition for the problem, together with any accumulation point of the sequence of a set of auxiliary Lagrangian multipliers. We also propose an efficient successive convex approximation method for computing an approximate D-stationary point of the penalty and AL subproblems. Finally, some numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods.

134,"The framework of budget-feasible mechanism design studies procurement auctions where the auctioneer (buyer) aims to maximize his valuation function subject to a hard budget constraint. We study the problem of designing truthful mechanisms that have good approximation guarantees and never pay the participating agents (sellers) more than the budget. We focus on the case of general (non-monotone) submodular valuation functions and derive the first truthful, budget-feasible, and O(1)-approximation mechanisms that run in polynomial time in the value query model, for both offline and online auctions. Prior to our work, the only O(1)-approximation mechanism known for non-monotone submodular objectives required an exponential number of value queries. At the heart of our approach lies a novel greedy algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization under a knapsack constraint. Our algorithm builds two candidate solutions simultaneously (to achieve a good approximation), yet ensures that agents cannot jump from one solution to the other (to implicitly enforce truthfulness). The fact that in our mechanism the agents are not ordered according to their marginal value per cost allows us to appropriately adapt these ideas to the online setting as well. To further illustrate the applicability of our approach, we also consider the case where additional feasibility constraints are present, for example, at most k agents can be selected. We obtain O(p)-approximation mechanisms for both monotone and non-monotone submodular objectives, when the feasible solutions are independent sets of a p-system. With the exception of additive valuation functions, no mechanisms were known for this setting prior to our work. Finally, we provide lower bounds suggesting that, when one cares about nontrivial approximation guarantees in polynomial time, our results are, asymptotically, the best possible.
","We study a dynamic pricing problem in which a buyer (i.e., a buyer who is willing to pay a fixed price) is constrained by a set of constraints on the buyer's willingness to pay. We propose a dynamic pricing framework that allows the buyer to choose between two types of pricing schemes: (1) a fixed price scheme that is based on a fixed-price-based pricing scheme and (2) a fixed-price-based pricing scheme that is based on a fixed-price-based pricing scheme. We show that the dynamic pricing framework can be used to solve a dynamic pricing problem with a single buyer. We also show that the dynamic pricing framework can be used to solve a dynamic pricing problem with multiple buyers.

135,"A sequential design problem for rank aggregation is commonly encountered in psychology, politics, marketing, sports, etc. In this problem, a decision maker is responsible for ranking K items by sequentially collecting noisy pairwise comparisons from judges. The decision maker needs to choose a pair of items for comparison in each step, decide when to stop data collection, and make a final decision after stopping based on a sequential flow of information. Because of the complex ranking structure, existing sequential analysis methods are not suitable. In this paper, we formulate the problem under a Bayesian decision framework and propose sequential procedures that are asymptotically optimal. These procedures achieve asymptotic optimality by seeking a balance between exploration (i.e., finding the most indistinguishable pair of items) and exploitation (i.e., comparing the most indistinguishable pair based on the current information). New analytical tools are developed for proving the asymptotic results, combining advanced change of measure techniques for handling the level crossing of likelihood ratios and classic large deviation results for martingales, which are of separate theoretical interest in solving complex sequential design problems. A mirror-descent algorithm is developed for the computation of the proposed sequential procedures.

137,"In this paper, we study second-order optimality conditions for nonconvex set-constrained optimization problems. For a convex set-constrained optimization problem, it is well known that second-order optimality conditions involve the support function of the second-order tangent set. In this paper, we propose two approaches for establishing second-order optimality conditions for the nonconvex case. In the first approach, we extend the concept of the support function so that it is applicable to general nonconvex set-constrained problems, whereas in the second approach, we introduce the notion of the directional regular tangent cone and apply classical results of convex duality theory. Besides the second-order optimality conditions, the novelty of our approach lies in the systematic introduction and use, respectively, of directional versions of well-known concepts from variational analysis.

138,"We study statistical estimators computed using iterative optimization methods that are not run until completion. Classical results on maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) assert that a one-step estimator (OSE), in which a single Newton-Raphson iteration is performed from a starting point with certain properties, is asymptotically equivalent to the MLE. We further develop these early-stopping results by deriving properties of one-step estimators defined by a single iteration of scaled proximal methods. Our main results show the asymptotic equivalence of the likelihood-based estimator and various one-step estimators defined by scaled proximal methods. By interpreting OSEs as the last of a sequence of iterates, our results provide insight on scaling numerical tolerance with sample size. Our setting contains scaled proximal gradient descent applied to certain composite models as a special case, making our results applicable to many problems of practical interest. Additionally, our results provide support for the utility of the scaled Moreau envelope as a statistical smoother by interpreting scaled proximal descent as a quasi-Newton method applied to the scaled Moreau envelope.

139,"Demand forecasting plays an important role in many inventory control problems. To mitigate the potential harms of model misspecification in this context, various forms of distributionally robust optimization have been applied. Although many of these methodologies suffer from the problem of time inconsistency, the work of Klabjan et al. established a general time-consistent framework for such problems by connecting to the literature on robust Markov decision processes. Motivated by the fact that many forecasting models exhibit very special structure as well as a desire to understand the impact of positing different dependency structures in distributionally robust multistage optimization, we formulate and solve a time-consistent distributionally robust multistage newsvendor model, which naturally robustifies some of the simplest inventory models with demand forecasting. In particular, in some of the simplest such models, demand evolves as a martingale (i.e., expected demand tomorrow equals realized demand today). We consider a robust variant of such models in which the sequence of future demands may be any martingale with given mean and support. Under such a model, past realizations of demand are naturally incorporated into the structure of the uncertainty set going forward. We explicitly compute the minimax optimal policy (and worst-case distribution) in closed form by combining ideas from convex analysis, probability, and dynamic programming. We prove that, at optimality, the worst-case demand distribution corresponds to the setting in which inventory may become obsolete at a random time. To gain further insight, we prove weak convergence (as the time horizon grows large) to a simple and intuitive process. We also compare with the analogous setting in which demand is independent across periods (analyzed previously by Shapiro) and identify several differences between these models in the spirit of the price of correlations studied by Agrawal et al. Finally, we complement our results by providing both numerical experiments that illustrate the potential benefits and limitations of our approach as well as additional theoretical analyses exploring what happens when our modeling assumptions do not hold.

140,"In this paper, we consider a broad class of nonsmooth and nonconvex fractional programs, which encompass many important modern optimization problems arising from diverse areas such as the recently proposed scale-invariant sparse signal reconstruction problem in signal processing. We propose a proximal subgradient algorithm with extrapolations for solving this optimization model and show that the iterated sequence generated by the algorithm is bounded and that any one of its limit points is a stationary point of the model problem. The choice of our extrapolation parameter is flexible and includes the popular extrapolation parameter adopted in the restarted fast iterative shrinking-threshold algorithm (FISTA). By providing a unified analysis framework of descent methods, we establish the convergence of the full sequence under the assumption that a suitable merit function satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property. Our algorithm exhibits linear convergence for the scale-invariant sparse signal reconstruction problem and the Rayleigh quotient problem over spherical constraint. When the denominator is the maximum of finitely many continuously differentiable weakly convex functions, we also propose another extrapolated proximal subgradient algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stronger notion of stationary points of the model problem.

141,"Self-concordance is the most important property required for barriers in convex programming. It is intrinsically linked to the affine structure of the underlying space. Here we introduce an alternative notion of self-concordance that is linked to the projective structure. A function on a set 𝑋X in an affine space is projectively self-concordant if and only if it can be extended to an affinely self-concordant logarithmically homogeneous function on the conic extension of X. The feasible sets in conic programs, notably linear and semidefinite programs, are naturally equipped with projectively self-concordant barriers. However, the interior-point methods used to solve these programs use only affine self-concordance. We show that estimates used in the analysis of interior-point methods are tighter for projective self-concordance, in particular inner and outer approximations of the set. This opens the way to a better tuning of parameters in interior-points algorithms to allow larger steps and hence faster convergence. Projective self-concordance is also a useful tool in the theoretical analysis of logarithmically homogeneous barriers on cones.

142,"We consider the problem of estimating the discrete clustering structures under the sub-Gaussian mixture model. Our main results establish a hidden integrality property of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for this problem: while the optimal solution to the SDP is not integer-valued in general, its estimation error can be upper bounded by that of an idealized integer program. The error of the integer program, and hence that of the SDP, are further shown to decay exponentially in the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we show that the SDP relaxation is robust under the semirandom setting in which an adversary can modify the data generated from the mixture model. In particular, we generalize the hidden integrality property to the semirandom model and thereby show that SDP achieves the optimal error bound in this setting. These results together highlight the “global-to-local” mechanism that drives the performance of the SDP relaxation. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first exponentially decaying error bound for convex relaxations of mixture models. A corollary of our results shows that in certain regimes, the SDP solutions are in fact integral and exact. More generally, our results establish sufficient conditions for the SDP to correctly recover the cluster memberships of (1−𝛿) fraction of the points for any 𝛿∈(0,1). As a special case, we show that under the 𝑑-dimensional stochastic ball model, SDP achieves nontrivial (sometimes exact) recovery when the center separation is as small as 1/𝑑‾‾‾√, which improves upon previous exact recovery results that require constant separation.

143,"Inspired by the recent developments in risk sharing problems for the value at risk (VaR), the expected shortfall (ES), and the range value at risk (RVaR), we study the optimization of risk sharing for general tail risk measures. Explicit formulas of the inf-convolution and Pareto-optimal allocations are obtained in the case of a mixed collection of left and right VaRs, and in that of a VaR and another tail risk measure. The inf-convolution of tail risk measures is shown to be a tail risk measure with an aggregated tail parameter, a phenomenon very similar to the cases of VaR, ES, and RVaR. Optimal allocations are obtained in the settings of elliptical models and model uncertainty. In particular, several results are established for tail risk measures in the presence of model uncertainty, which may be of independent interest outside the framework of risk sharing. The technical conclusions are quite general without assuming any form of convexity of the tail risk measures. Our analysis generalizes in several directions the recent literature on quantile-based risk sharing.

144,"The Bayesian persuasion paradigm of strategic communication models interaction between a privately informed sender and an ignorant but rational receiver. The goal is typically to design a (near-)optimal communication (or signaling) scheme for the sender. It enables the sender to disclose information to the receiver in a way as to incentivize her to take an action that is preferred by the sender. Finding the optimal signaling scheme is known to be computationally difficult in general. This hardness is further exacerbated when the message space is constrained, leading to NP-hardness of approximating the optimal sender utility within any constant factor. In this paper, we show that in several natural and prominent cases the optimization problem is tractable even when the message space is limited. In particular, we study signaling under a symmetry or an independence assumption on the distribution of utility values for the actions. For symmetric distributions, we provide a novel characterization of the optimal signaling scheme. It results in a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an optimal scheme for many compactly represented symmetric distributions. In the independent case, we design a constant-factor approximation algorithm, which stands in marked contrast to the hardness of approximation in the general case.

145,"We develop techniques to convexify a set that is invariant under permutation and/or change of sign of variables and discuss applications of these results. First, we convexify the intersection of the unit ball of a permutation and sign-invariant norm with a cardinality constraint. This gives a nonlinear formulation for the feasible set of sparse principal component analysis (PCA) and an alternative proof of the K-support norm. Second, we characterize the convex hull of sets of matrices defined by constraining their singular values. As a consequence, we generalize an earlier result that characterizes the convex hull of rank-constrained matrices whose spectral norm is below a given threshold. Third, we derive convex and concave envelopes of various permutation-invariant nonlinear functions and their level sets over hypercubes, with congruent bounds on all variables. Finally, we develop new relaxations for the exterior product of sparse vectors. Using these relaxations for sparse PCA, we show that our relaxation closes 98% of the gap left by a classical semidefinite programming relaxation for instances where the covariance matrices are of dimension up to 50 × 50.

146,"We consider the problem of a firm seeking to use personalized pricing to sell an exogenously given stock of a product over a finite selling horizon to different consumer types. We assume that the type of an arriving consumer can be observed, but the demand function associated with each type is initially unknown. The firm sets personalized prices dynamically for each type and attempts to maximize the revenue over the season. We provide a learning algorithm that is near optimal when the demand and capacity scale in proportion. The algorithm utilizes the primal–dual formulation of the problem and learns the dual optimal solution explicitly. It allows the algorithm to overcome the curse of dimensionality (the rate of regret is independent of the number of types) and sheds light on novel algorithmic designs for learning problems with resource constraints.

147,"An important question that arises in the study of high-dimensional vector representations learned from data are, given a set 𝒟 of vectors and a query q, estimate the number of points within a specified distance threshold of q. We develop two estimators, LSH count and multiprobe count that use locality-sensitive hashing to preprocess the data to accurately and efficiently estimate the answers to such questions via importance sampling. A key innovation is the ability to maintain a small number of hash tables via preprocessing data structures and algorithms that sample from multiple buckets in each hash table. We give bounds on the space requirements and sample complexity of our schemes and demonstrate their effectiveness in experiments on a standard word embedding data set.

148,"This paper deals with constrained convex problems, where the objective function is smooth and strongly convex, and the feasible set is described by a large number of closed convex (possibly nonpolyhedral) sets. In order to deal efficiently with the complicated constraints, we consider a dual formulation of this problem. We prove that the corresponding dual function satisfies a quadratic growth property on any sublevel set, provided that the primal objective function is smooth and strongly convex and the feasible set verifies Slater’s condition. We propose (accelerated) random coordinate descent algorithms that use the special composite structure of the dual problem. However, with the existing theory, one can prove only that such methods converge sublinearly. Based on our new quadratic growth property derived for the dual problem, we show that such methods have faster convergence, that is, the dual (accelerated) random coordinate descent algorithms converge linearly. Besides providing a general dual framework for the analysis of random dual coordinate descent schemes, our results resolve an open problem in the literature related to the convergence of the Dykstra algorithm on the best feasibility problem for a collection of convex sets. That is, we establish linear convergence rate for the random Dykstra algorithm when the convex sets just satisfy Slater’s condition and derive also a new accelerated variant for the Dykstra algorithm.

149,"We study the problem of maximizing a nonmonotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint in the streaming model. Our main contribution is a single-pass (semi) streaming algorithm that uses roughly O(k/ε2)𝑂(𝑘/𝜀2) memory, where k is the size constraint. At the end of the stream, our algorithm postprocesses its data structure using any off-line algorithm for submodular maximization and obtains a solution whose approximation guarantee is α/(1+α)−ε𝛼/(1+𝛼)−𝜀, where α is the approximation of the off-line algorithm. If we use an exact (exponential time) postprocessing algorithm, this leads to 1/2−ε1/2−𝜀 approximation (which is nearly optimal). If we postprocess with the state-of-the-art offline approximation algorithm, whose guarantee is α=0.385𝛼=0.385, we obtain a 0.2779-approximation in polynomial time, improving over the previously best polynomial-time approximation of 0.1715. It is also worth mentioning that our algorithm is combinatorial and deterministic, which is rare for an algorithm for nonmonotone submodular maximization, and enjoys a fast update time of O(ε−2(logk+log(1+α)))𝑂(𝜀−2(log𝑘+log(1+𝛼))) per element.

150,"We consider a connection-level model proposed by Massoulié and Roberts for bandwidth sharing among file transfer flows in a communication network. We study weighted proportionally fair sharing policies and establish explicit-form bounds on the weighted sum of the expected numbers of flows on different routes in heavy traffic. The bounds are linear in the number of critically loaded links in the network, and they hold for a class of phase-type file-size distributions; that is, the bounds are heavy-traffic insensitive to the distributions in this class. Our approach is Lyapunov drift based, which is different from the widely used diffusion approximation approach. A key technique we develop is to construct a novel inner product in the state space, which then allows us to obtain a multiplicative type of state-space collapse in steady state. Furthermore, this state-space collapse result implies the interchange of limits as a byproduct for the diffusion approximation of the unweighted proportionally fair sharing policy under phase-type file-size distributions, demonstrating the heavy-traffic insensitivity of the stationary distribution.

151,"After showing, by means of a series of examples, that paradigms alternative to the Bayesian one obtain by simply replacing the notion of approximation associated with the latter, the paper presents a unified framework for theories of decision making and inference. Given a statistical model, the algebra of bounded random variables on the sample space is mapped homomorphically into an algebra of operators on a certain Hilbert space. Then, the choice of a norm or a divergence function on the latter algebra produces a theory of decision making and inference. Examples include models from the Choquet expected utility class, models from robust statistics, the smooth model, maxmin and maxmax (as limiting cases) as well as a novel theory. The paper also contributes to Bayesian theory, which obtains in correspondence to a Hilbert norm. It shows that Bayes’ theorem can be derived from the fundamental concept of conditional expectation and that it is the only updating rule for which the operations of updating and of calculating the predictive commute.

152,"This paper studies the existence of pure Nash equilibria in atomic congestion games with different user classes where the cost of each resource depends on the aggregated demand of each class. A set of cost functions is called consistent for this class if all games with cost functions from the set have a pure Nash equilibrium. We give a complete characterization of consistent sets of cost functions showing that the only consistent sets of cost functions are sets of certain affine functions and sets of certain exponential functions. This characterization is also extended to a larger class of games where each atomic player may control flow that belongs to different classes.

153,"We introduce a generalized version of the concave Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) property by employing nonsmooth desingularizing functions. We also present the exact modulus of the generalized concave KL property, which provides an answer to the open question regarding the optimal concave desingularizing function. The exact modulus is designed to be the smallest among all possible concave desingularizing functions. Examples are given to illustrate this pleasant property. In turn, using the exact modulus, we provide the sharpest upper bound for the total length of iterates generated by the celebrated Bolte-Sabach-Teboulle proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm.

154,"Does a large width eliminate all suboptimal local minima for neural nets? An affirmative answer was given by a classic result published in 1995 for one-hidden-layer wide neural nets with a sigmoid activation function, but this result has not been extended to the multilayer case. Recently, it was shown that, with piecewise linear activations, suboptimal local minima exist even for wide nets. Given the classic positive result on smooth activation and the negative result on nonsmooth activations, an interesting open question is: Does a large width eliminate all suboptimal local minima for deep neural nets with smooth activation? In this paper, we give a largely negative answer to this question. Specifically, we prove that, for neural networks with generic input data and smooth nonlinear activation functions, suboptimal local minima can exist no matter how wide the network is (as long as the last hidden layer has at least two neurons). Therefore, the classic result of no suboptimal local minimum for a one-hidden-layer network does not hold. Whereas this classic result assumes sigmoid activation, our counterexample covers a large set of activation functions (dense in the set of continuous functions), indicating that the limitation is not a result of the specific activation. Together with recent progress on piecewise linear activations, our result indicates that suboptimal local minima are common for wide neural nets.

155,"Much of the recent literature on bandit learning focuses on algorithms that aim to converge on an optimal action. One shortcoming is that this orientation does not account for time sensitivity, which can play a crucial role when learning an optimal action requires much more information than near-optimal ones. Indeed, popular approaches, such as upper-confidence-bound methods and Thompson sampling, can fare poorly in such situations. We consider instead learning a satisficing action, which is near-optimal while requiring less information, and propose satisficing Thompson sampling, an algorithm that serves this purpose. We establish a general bound on expected discounted regret and study the application of satisficing Thompson sampling to linear and infinite-armed bandits, demonstrating arbitrarily large benefits over Thompson sampling. We also discuss the relation between the notion of satisficing and the theory of rate distortion, which offers guidance on the selection of satisficing actions.

156,"Forcing finite state mean field games by a relevant form of common noise is a subtle issue, which has been addressed only recently. Among others, one possible way is to subject the simplex valued dynamics of an equilibrium by a so-called Wright–Fisher noise, very much in the spirit of stochastic models in population genetics. A key feature is that such a random forcing preserves the structure of the simplex, which is nothing but, in this setting, the probability space over the state space of the game. The purpose of this article is, hence, to elucidate the finite-player version and, accordingly, prove that N-player equilibria indeed converge toward the solution of such a kind of Wright–Fisher mean field game. Whereas part of the analysis is made easier by the fact that the corresponding master equation has already been proved to be uniquely solvable under the presence of the common noise, it becomes however more subtle than in the standard setting because the mean field interaction between the players now occurs through a weighted empirical measure. In other words, each player carries its own weight, which, hence, may differ from 1/𝑁 and which, most of all, evolves with the common noise.

157,"We study a McKean–Vlasov optimal control problem with common noise in order to establish the corresponding limit theory as well as the equivalence between different formulations, including strong, weak, and relaxed formulations. In contrast to the strong formulation, in which the problem is formulated on a fixed probability space equipped with two Brownian filtrations, the weak formulation is obtained by considering a more general probability space with two filtrations satisfying an (H)-hypothesis type condition from the theory of enlargement of filtrations. When the common noise is uncontrolled, our relaxed formulation is obtained by considering a suitable controlled martingale problem. As for classic optimal control problems, we prove that the set of all relaxed controls is the closure of the set of all strong controls when considered as probability measures on the canonical space. Consequently, we obtain the equivalence of the different formulations of the control problem under additional mild regularity conditions on the reward functions. This is also a crucial technical step to prove the limit theory of the McKean–Vlasov control problem, that is, proving that it consists in the limit of a large population control problem with common noise.

158,"In this paper, we establish an equivalence relation between partially symmetric tensors and homogeneous polynomials, prove that every partially symmetric tensor has a partially symmetric canonical polyadic (CP)-decomposition, and present three semidefinite relaxation algorithms. The first algorithm is used to check whether there exists a positive partially symmetric real CP-decomposition for a partially symmetric real tensor and give a decomposition if it has. The second algorithm is used to compute general partial symmetric real CP-decompositions. The third algorithm is used to compute positive partially symmetric complex CP-decomposition of partially symmetric complex tensors. Because for different parameters 𝑠,𝑚𝑖,𝑛𝑖, partially symmetric tensors 𝒯∈𝑆[𝐦]𝔽[𝐧] represent different kinds of tensors. Hence, the proposed algorithms can be used to compute different types of tensor real/complex CP-decomposition, including general nonsymmetric CP-decomposition, positive symmetric CP-decomposition, positive partially symmetric CP-decomposition, general partially symmetric CP-decomposition, etc. Numerical examples show that the algorithms are effective.

159,"This paper discusses distributionally robust geometric programs with individual or joint chance constraints. Several groups of uncertainty sets are considered: uncertainty sets with first two order moments information; uncertainty sets with known first order or first two order moments information under nonnegative support; uncertainty sets constrained by the Kullback–Leibler divergence with a normal or discrete reference distribution; uncertainty sets constrained by the Wasserstein distance under discrete, full, or nonnegative real-space support; and joint uncertainty sets for the product of random variables. Under each group of uncertainty sets, we find deterministic reformulations of the distributionally robust geometric programs with individual or joint chance constraints. Convexity, solution methods, and relationships of the reformulation programs are discussed. Finally, numerical tests are carried out on a shape optimization problem.

160,"This paper revisits the parametric analysis of semidefinite optimization problems with respect to the perturbation of the objective function along a fixed direction. We review the notions of invariancy set, nonlinearity interval, and transition point of the optimal partition, and we investigate their characterizations. We show that the set of transition points is finite and the continuity of the optimal set mapping, on the basis of Painlevé–Kuratowski set convergence, might fail on a nonlinearity interval. Under a local nonsingularity condition, we then develop a methodology, stemming from numerical algebraic geometry, to efficiently compute nonlinearity intervals and transition points of the optimal partition. Finally, we support the theoretical results by applying our procedure to some numerical examples.

161,"In a Stackelberg max closure game, we are given a digraph whose vertices correspond to projects from which firms can choose and whose arcs represent precedence constraints. Some projects are under the control of a leader who sets prices in the first stage of the game, while in the second stage, the firms choose a feasible subset of projects of maximum value. For a single follower, the leader’s problem of finding revenue-maximizing prices can be solved in strongly polynomial time. In this paper, we focus on the setting with multiple followers and distinguish two situations. In the case in which only one copy of each project is available (limited supply), we show that the two-follower problem is solvable in strongly polynomial time, whereas the problem with three or more followers is NP-hard. In the case of unlimited supply, that is, when sufficient copies of each project are available, we show that the two-follower problem is already APX-hard. As a side result, we prove that Stackelberg min vertex cover on bipartite graphs with a single follower is APX-hard.

162,"In this paper, we study the local variational geometry of the optimal solution set of the trust region subproblem (TRS), which minimizes a general, possibly nonconvex, quadratic function over the unit ball. Specifically, we demonstrate that a Hölderian error bound holds globally for the TRS with modulus 1/4, and the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) inequality holds locally for the TRS with a KL exponent 3/4 at any optimal solution. We further prove that, unless in a special case, the Hölderian error bound modulus and the KL exponent is 1/2. Finally, as a byproduct, we further apply the obtained KL property to show that projected gradient methods studied elsewhere for solving the TRS achieve a local sublinear or even linear rate of convergence with probability 1 by choosing a proper initial point.

We present a successive convex programming-based sampling algorithm and establish its subsequential convergence. We describe stationary properties of the limit points for several classes of the compound SP. We further discuss probabilistic stopping rules based on the computable error bound for the algorithm. We present several risk measure minimization problems that can be formulated as such a compound stochastic program; these include generalized deviation optimization problems based on the optimized certainty equivalent and buffered probability of exceedance (bPOE), a distributionally robust bPOE optimization problem, and a multiclass classification problem employing the cost-sensitive error criteria with bPOE.

164,"Repugnant transactions are sometimes banned, but legal bans sometimes give rise to active black markets that are difficult if not impossible to extinguish. We explore a model in which the probability of extinguishing a black market depends on the extent to which its transactions are regarded as repugnant as measured by the proportion of the population that disapproves of them and the intensity of that repugnance as measured by willingness to punish. Sufficiently repugnant markets can be extinguished with even mild punishments, whereas others are insufficiently repugnant for this and become exponentially more difficult to extinguish the larger they become and the longer they survive.

165,"We consider taxation of exchanges among a set of agents in which each agent owns one object. Agents may have different valuations for the objects, and they need to pay taxes for exchanges. We show that, if a rule satisfies individual rationality, strategy-proofness, constrained efficiency, weak anonymity, and weak consistency, then it is either the no-trade rule or a fixed-tax core rule. For the latter rules, whenever any agent exchanges an object, the agent pays the same fixed tax (a lump sum payment that is identical for all agents) independently of which object the agent consumes. Gale’s top trading cycles algorithm finds the final assignment using the agents’ valuations adjusted with the fixed tax if the induced preferences are strict.

166,"We study the heavy-traffic limit of the generalized switch operating under MaxWeight, without assuming that the complete resource pooling condition is satisfied and allowing for correlated arrivals. The main contribution of this paper is the steady-state mean of linear combinations of queue lengths in heavy traffic. We showcase the generality of our result by presenting various stochastic networks as corollaries, each of which is a contribution by itself. In particular, we study the input-queued switch with correlated arrivals, and we show that, if the state space collapses to a full-dimensional subspace, the correlation among the arrival processes does not matter in heavy traffic. We exemplify this last case with a parallel-server system, an 𝒩N-system, and an ad hoc wireless network. Whereas these results are obtained using the drift method, we additionally present a negative result showing a limitation of the drift method. We show that it is not possible to obtain the individual queue lengths using the drift method with polynomial test functions. We do this by presenting an alternate view of the drift method in terms of a system of linear equations, and we use this system of equations to obtain bounds on arbitrary linear combinations of the queue lengths.

167,"The resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) addresses the problem of constructing a schedule with minimum makespan for a set of activities, subject to precedence and resource constraints. Recent research introduced a data set with small instances that cannot be solved by the state-of-the-art algorithms, revealing a gap in our understanding of instance complexity. We propose a new theoretical framework for the instance complexity for the RCPSP, consecutively incorporating precedence constraints, resource constraints, and activity durations. Our approach contributes to the existing knowledge base in two ways. First, it is independent from solution algorithms, which enables generalisable conclusions. Second, the theoretical perspective enables a deeper understanding of the drivers of instance complexity. We evaluate the performance of our approach with a series of computational experiments. These show that our framework is a strong discriminator between easy and hard instances and explains a large fraction of CPU times of optimal solution algorithms.

169,"We introduce the pipeline intervention problem, defined by a layered directed acyclic graph and a set of stochastic matrices governing transitions between successive layers. The graph is a stylized model for how people from different populations are presented opportunities, eventually leading to some reward. In our model, individuals are born into an initial position (i.e., some node in the first layer of the graph) according to a fixed probability distribution and then stochastically progress through the graph according to the transition matrices until they reach a node in the final layer of the graph; each node in the final layer has a reward associated with it. The pipeline intervention problem asks how to best make costly changes to the transition matrices governing people’s stochastic transitions through the graph subject to a budget constraint. We consider two objectives: social welfare maximization and a fairness-motivated maximin objective that seeks to maximize the value to the population (starting node) with the least expected value. We consider two variants of the maximin objective that turn out to be distinct, depending on whether we demand a deterministic solution or allow randomization. For each objective, we give an efficient approximation algorithm (an additive fully polynomial-time approximation scheme) for constant-width networks. We also tightly characterize the “price of fairness” in our setting: the ratio between the highest achievable social welfare and the social welfare consistent with a maximin optimal solution. Finally, we show that, for polynomial-width networks, even approximating the maximin objective to any constant factor is NP hard even for networks with constant depth. This shows that the restriction on the width in our positive results is essential.

170,"Entropy regularization has been extensively adopted to improve the efficiency, the stability, and the convergence of algorithms in reinforcement learning. This paper analyzes both quantitatively and qualitatively the impact of entropy regularization for mean field games (MFGs) with learning in a finite time horizon. Our study provides a theoretical justification that entropy regularization yields time-dependent policies and, furthermore, helps stabilizing and accelerating convergence to the game equilibrium. In addition, this study leads to a policy-gradient algorithm with exploration in MFG. With this algorithm, agents are able to learn the optimal exploration scheduling, with stable and fast convergence to the game equilibrium.

171,"In this paper, we are concerned with bounding agents’ residence times in the network for a broad class of atomic dynamic routings. We explore novel token techniques to circumvent direct analysis on complicated chain effects of dynamic routing choices. Even though agents may enter the network over time for an infinite number of periods, we prove that under a mild condition, the residence time of every agent is upper bounded (by a network-dependent constant plus the total number of agents inside the network at the entry time of the agent). Applying this result to three game models of atomic dynamic routing in the recent literature, we establish that the residence times of selfish agents in a series-parallel network with a single origin-destination pair are upper bounded at equilibrium, provided the number of incoming agents at each time point does not exceed the network capacity (i.e., the smallest total capacity of edges in the network whose removal separates the origin from the destination).

172,"Noting that the existing Slater condition, as a fundamental constraint qualification in optimization, is only applicable in the convex setting, we introduce and study the Slater condition for the Bouligand and Clarke tangent derivatives of a general vector-valued function F with respect to a closed convex cone K. Without any assumption, it is proved that the Slater condition for the Clarke (respectively, Bouligand) tangent derivative with respect to K is always stable when the objective function F undergoes small Lipschitz (calm) perturbations. Based on this, we prove that if the Clarke (Bouligand) tangent derivative of F satisfies the Slater condition (with respect to K) then the conic inequality determined by F has a stable metric subregularity when F undergoes small Lipschitz (calm regular) perturbations. In the composite-convexity case, the converse implication is also proved to be true. Moreover, under the Slater condition for the tangent derivative of F, it is proved that the normal cone to the sublevel set of F can be formulated by the subdifferential of F, which improves the corresponding results in either the smooth or convex case. As applications, without any qualification assumption, we improve and generalize formulas for the normal cone to a convex sublevel set by Cabot and Thibault [(2014), Sequential formulae for the normal cone to sublevel sets. Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 366(12):6591–6628]. With the help of these formulas, some new Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions are established.

173,"We propose a simple projection and rescaling algorithm that finds maximum support solutions to the pair of feasibility problems: find x∈L∩Rn+  and find ˆx∈L⊥∩Rn+,𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑥∈𝐿∩ℝ𝑛+and𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑥ˆ∈𝐿⊥∩ℝ𝑛+, where L is a linear subspace in Rnℝ𝑛 and L⊥ is its orthogonal complement. The algorithm complements a basic procedure that involves only projections onto L and L⊥ with a periodic rescaling step. The number of rescaling steps and, thus, overall computational work performed by the algorithm are bounded above in terms of a condition measure of the above pair of problems. Our algorithm is a natural but significant extension of a previous projection and rescaling algorithm that finds a solution to the full support problem: find x∈L∩Rn++ when this problem is feasible. As a byproduct of our new developments, we obtain a sharper analysis of the projection and rescaling algorithm in the latter special case.

174,"Motivated by bursty bandwidth allocation and by the allocation of virtual machines to servers in the cloud, we consider the online problem of packing items with random sizes into unit-capacity bins. Items arrive sequentially, but on arrival, an item’s actual size is unknown; only its probabilistic information is available to the decision maker. Without knowing this size, the decision maker must irrevocably pack the item into an available bin or place it in a new bin. Once packed in a bin, the decision maker observes the item’s actual size, and overflowing the bin is a possibility. An overflow incurs a large penalty cost, and the corresponding bin is unusable for the rest of the process. In practical terms, this overflow models delayed services, failure of servers, and/or loss of end-user goodwill. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost given by the sum of the number of opened bins and the overflow penalty cost. We present an online algorithm with expected cost at most a constant factor times the cost incurred by the optimal packing policy when item sizes are drawn from an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence of unknown length. We give a similar result when item size distributions are exponential with arbitrary rates. We also study the offline model, where distributions are known in advance but must be packed sequentially. We construct a soft-capacity polynomial-time approximation scheme for this problem and show that the complexity of computing the optimal offline cost is #𝐏#P-hard. Finally, we provide an empirical study of our online algorithm’s performance.

175,"Consensus halving refers to the problem of dividing a resource into two parts so that every agent values both parts equally. Prior work shows that, when the resource is represented by an interval, a consensus halving with at most n cuts always exists but is hard to compute even for agents with simple valuation functions. In this paper, we study consensus halving in a natural setting in which the resource consists of a set of items without a linear ordering. For agents with linear and additively separable utilities, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a consensus halving with at most n cuts and show that n cuts are almost surely necessary when the agents’ utilities are randomly generated. On the other hand, we show that, for a simple class of monotonic utilities, the problem already becomes polynomial parity argument, directed version–hard. Furthermore, we compare and contrast consensus halving with the more general problem of consensus k-splitting, with which we wish to divide the resource into k parts in possibly unequal ratios and provide some consequences of our results on the problem of computing small agreeable sets.

176,"We consider the Hypergraph-k-Cut problem. The input consists of a hypergraph G=(V,E)𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸) with nonnegative hyperedge-costs c:E→R+𝑐:𝐸→ℝ+ and a positive integer k. The objective is to find a minimum cost subset F⊆E𝐹⊆𝐸 such that the number of connected components in G – F is at least k. An alternative formulation of the objective is to find a partition of V into k nonempty sets V1,V2,…,Vk𝑉1,𝑉2,…,𝑉𝑘 so as to minimize the cost of the hyperedges that cross the partition. Graph-k-Cut, the special case of Hypergraph-k-Cut obtained by restricting to graph inputs, has received considerable attention. Several different approaches lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for Graph-k-Cut when k is fixed, starting with the work of Goldschmidt and Hochbaum (Math of OR, 1994). In contrast, it is only recently that a randomized polynomial time algorithm for Hypergraph-k-Cut was developed (Chandrasekaran, Xu, Yu, Math Programming, 2019) via a subtle generalization of Karger’s random contraction approach for graphs. In this work, we develop the first deterministic algorithm for Hypergraph-k-Cut that runs in polynomial time for any fixed k. We describe two algorithms both of which are based on a divide and conquer approach. The first algorithm is simpler and runs in nO(k2)m𝑛𝑂(𝑘2)𝑚 time while the second one runs in nO(k)m𝑛𝑂(𝑘)𝑚 time, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of hyperedges in the input hypergraph. Our proof relies on new structural results that allow for efficient recovery of the parts of an optimum k-partition by solving minimum (S,T)-terminal cuts. Our techniques give new insights even for Graph-k-Cut.

177,"This article presents a framework for understanding and revitalizing the important role of conceptual articles in the development of knowledge in the marketing discipline. An analysis of 30 years (1978–2007) of publishing data from major marketing journals indicates that conceptual articles are declining, despite repeated calls for more emphasis on this form of scholarship. The sharpest decline has occurred in Journal of Marketing (JM), with much of the shift occurring over the past decade. Many substantive areas remain largely unexplored in conceptual articles. Over this 30-year period, conceptual articles published in JM have disproportionately more citations relative to their numbers, attesting to the importance of their role in knowledge development. Addressing the decline of conceptual articles and restoring their synergistic balance with other forms of scholarship will require concerted efforts on several interrelated fronts: the current generation of scholars; doctoral programs and students; journals, reviewers, and review process; and promotion, tenure, and incentive systems.

178,"Marketing decision makers are increasingly aware of the importance of shareholder value maximization, which calls for an evaluation of the long-term effects of their actions on product-market response and investor response. However, the marketing literature to date has focused on the sales or profit response of marketing actions, and the goals of marketing have traditionally been formulated from a customer perspective. Recently, there have been a few studies of the long-term investor response to marketing actions. The current research investigates one important aspect of this impact, the long-term relationship between advertising spending and market capitalization. The authors hypothesize that advertising can have a direct effect on valuation (i.e., an effect beyond its indirect effect through sales revenue and profit response). The empirical results across two industries provide support for the hypothesis that advertising spending has a positive, long-term impact on own firms’ market capitalization and may have a negative impact on the valuation of a competitor of comparable size. The authors quantify the magnitude of this investor response effect for and discuss its implications for further research.

179,"Prior research on relative thinking has suggested that the willingness to seek a bargain depends not only on the absolute value of the bargain but also on the price of the product. For example, a discount of $10 seems more appealing on a product whose regular price is $20 than a product whose regular price is $60. By invoking the interactive role of consumers’ reference prices, the authors delineate the specific conditions under which the same $10 discount can seem less appealing when the price is $20 than when it is $60. They present a formal model that simultaneously incorporates the effects of relative and referent thinking and yields novel predictions, which are supported in four laboratory experiments. Their results reveal that deviation from the reference price determines when relative thinking holds and when it gets reversed. Specifically, the relative-thinking effect holds when the actual price is the same as expected, it reverses when the actual price deviates from the expected price, but it emerges again when deviation from the expected price becomes extreme. The authors conclude with the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings for marketing activities, such as the allocation of sales promotion budgets.

180,"Using the literature on both pricing and regret, the authors develop a conceptual model of purchase likelihood and propose a pricing tactic that appears to have marketplace potential. Sellers currently using a hi–lo pricing tactic discount a product for a limited time and then raise the price back to its original level in one step. Here, the authors investigate whether sellers should return prices to their prepromotion levels all at once or in steps. They propose that sellers should consider an alternative tactic, labeled “steadily decreasing discounting” (SDD). This alternative tactic requires that the seller offer one or more additional discounts that are less than the prior discount before returning the product to its original price. Study 1 is a laboratory experiment that tests the proposed underlying mechanisms (future price expectations and anticipated inaction regret) influencing likelihood to buy. In Study 2, an additional laboratory experiment is undertaken to provide further empirical support in favor of the SDD tactic, to address alternative explanations for the findings, and to demonstrate that there are no negative perceptions associated with using SDD. Study 3 is a field experiment that assesses the effectiveness of SDD, and Study 4 examines scanner panel data to evaluate its generalizability.

181,"Companies have recently begun to use the Internet to integrate their customers more actively into various phases of the new product development process. One such strategy involves empowering customers to cooperate in selecting the product concepts to be marketed by the firm. In such scenarios, it is no longer the company but rather its customers who decide democratically which products should be produced. This article discusses the first set of empirical studies that highlight the important psychological consequences of this power shift. The results indicate that customers who are empowered to select the products to be marketed show stronger demand for the underlying products even though they are of identical quality in objective terms (and their subjective product evaluations are similar). This seemingly irrational finding can be observed because consumers develop a stronger feeling of psychological ownership of the products selected. The studies also identify two boundary conditions for this “empowerment–product demand” effect: It diminishes (1) if the outcome of the joint decision-making process does not reflect consumers’ preferences and (2) if consumers do not believe that they have the relevant competence to make sound decisions.

182,"This research documents how implicit theories regarding personality traits (whether they are deemed to be fixed or malleable) affect consumer inferences about the malleability of a brand's personality traits and, thus, its ability to extend into new categories. Study 1 documents that consumers who believe that traits are malleable (incremental theorists) are more accepting of brand extensions than consumers who believe that traits are fixed (entity theorists). These results hold whether implicit theories are measured or manipulated. Study 2 reveals how implicit theories affect consumers’ perceptions regarding the flexibility of a brand's personality traits and not its physical traits. Study 3 demonstrates that consumers primed with different implicit theory orientations respond differently to varying degrees of change within a single trait. This study tests the limits of the effect and demonstrates the impact of using primes embedded within standard marketing communication.

183,"This research addresses three questions: (1) How do salespeople get their desired product modifications implemented within organizations? (2) What effect does salesperson trustworthiness have on the means they adopt to get product modifications implemented? and (3) What are the performance outcomes of the modified products? The results from a survey of 149 product managers in small manufacturing organizations suggest that two influence strategies—rationality and exchange—have a positive impact and that two influence strategies—coalition building and upward appeal—have an inverse impact on product modification implementation. The results also show that salesperson trustworthiness enhances the positive effects of rationality and exchange while mitigating the inverse effects of coalition building and upward appeal. Finally, the results show that product modification implementation has a positive effect on the product's performance in the marketplace. Collectively, the results suggest that salespeople should adopt the rationality and exchange strategies to get their desired product modifications implemented while also developing a reputation for trustworthiness and that it pays for organizations to listen to their salespeople.

184,"This research investigates how movie ratings from professional critics, amateur communities, and viewers themselves influence key movie performance measures (i.e., movie revenues and new movie ratings). Using movie-level data, the authors find that high early movie revenues enhance subsequent movie ratings. They also find that high advertising spending on movies supported by high ratings maximizes the movie's revenues. Furthermore, they empirically show that sequel movies tend to reap more revenues but receive lower ratings than originals. Using individual viewer–level data, this research highlights how viewers’ own viewing and rating histories and movie communities’ collective opinions explain viewer satisfaction. The authors find that various aspects of these ratings explain viewers’ new movie ratings as a measure of viewer satisfaction, after controlling for movie characteristics. Furthermore, they find that viewers’ movie experiences can cause them to become more critical in ratings over time. Finally, they find a U-shaped relationship between viewers’ genre preferences and genre-specific movie ratings for heavy viewers.

185,"Drawing from institutional theory in sociology, this article theorizes the process of “megamarketing”—defined by Kotler (1986) as the use of strategic efforts by a firm or firms to gain the cooperation of multiple stakeholders—to understand how new industries are created and sustained in a complex social and political context. The author uses an analysis of the casino gambling industry to demonstrate the role of normative and regulatory structures in facilitating the adoption and eventual acceptance of an industry through the social process of legitimation. In a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of 7211 newspaper articles from 1980 to 2007, the author finds that frames such as crime, business, and regulation change over time and that these frames are used by multiple stakeholders to structure normative conceptions about the practice of casino gambling. These findings contribute to a theoretical understanding of market creation and development over time and provide marketing managers with the conceptual tools for megamarketing in any industry.

186,"This study represents the first empirical examination of the “Rule of Three,” a theory at odds with several popular notions regarding industry structure and business performance, including the positive linear market share–performance relationship. In general, the findings from more than 160 industries support the Rule of Three and provide five main insights: First, there appears to be a prevalent competitive structure for mature industries in which three “generalist” firms control the market. Second, industries that conform to this structure tend to perform better than industries with a fewer or greater number of generalists. Third, both “specialists” and generalists outperform firms that are “stuck in the middle.” Fourth, the performance benefits of market leadership appear to diminish with excessive market share. Fifth, the Rule of Three industry structure and its influence over firm profitability do not appear to be priced appropriately by financial markets. The authors discuss the implications for multiple stakeholders.

187,"The music industry has widely viewed digital rights management (DRM) as an effective strategy for reducing digital piracy. Digital rights management systems aim to prevent unauthorized copying and to reduce the overall rate of piracy. Therefore, the recent move toward offering DRM-free music by some major online music sellers appears paradoxical. In this article, the authors propose a model that conceptualizes and estimates the concept of hardcore piracy in an attempt to resolve this apparent paradox. Based on two large empirical studies and a validation exercise with a large sample of more 2000 college students, the model results indicate that the music industry can benefit from removing DRM because such a strategy has the potential to convert some pirates into paying consumers. In addition, a DRM-free environment enhances both consumer and producer welfare by increasing the demand for legitimate products as well as consumers’ willingness to pay for these products. The authors find that producers could benefit by lowering prices from currently observed levels. The article concludes with a discussion of the practical implications of the findings for managers within the music industry.

188,"Recent research suggests that inseparability is not a universal distinguishing characteristic of services and that the consumption of many services is or can be separated from their production. This research defines service separation as customers’ absence from service production, which denotes the spatial separation between service production and consumption. In a series of qualitative and quantitative studies across different services, the authors examine customer reactions to service separation. The results indicate that service separation increases customers’ perceptions of not only access convenience and benefit convenience but also performance risk and psychological risk. Furthermore, these effects differ across services. Specifically, relative to experience services, for credence services, the effects of separation on service convenience are mitigated, and the effects on perceived risk are magnified. Subsequently, the convenience and risk perceptions induced by service separation can influence customers’ purchase decisions and postexperience evaluations. Customers prefer separation for experience services and when they have an established relationship with the service provider. Finally, the authors discuss the theoretical contributions and managerial implications and offer directions for further research.
","We examine the relationship between the quality of service provided by a service provider and the quality of its customers’ satisfaction with the service provided by a service provider. We find that the quality of service provided by a service provider is positively related to the quality of its customers’ satisfaction with the service provided by a service provider. However, the quality of service provided by a service provider is negatively related to the quality of its customers’ satisfaction with the service provided by a service provider.

189,"Word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing—firms’ intentional influencing of consumer-to-consumer communications—is an increasingly important technique. Reviewing and synthesizing extant WOM theory, this article shows how marketers employing social media marketing methods face a situation of networked coproduction of narratives. It then presents a study of a marketing campaign in which mobile phones were seeded with prominent bloggers. Eighty-three blogs were followed for six months. The findings indicate that this network of communications offers four social media communication strategies—evaluation, embracing, endorsement, and explanation. Each is influenced by character narrative, communications forum, communal norms, and the nature of the marketing promotion. This new narrative model shows that communal WOM does not simply increase or amplify marketing messages; rather, marketing messages and meanings are systematically altered in the process of embedding them. The theory has definite, pragmatic implications for how marketers should plan, target, and leverage WOM and how scholars should understand WOM in a networked world.
","The digital transformation of the media industry has been a major challenge for organizations. In this paper, we examine how the digital transformation of the media industry affects the perception of the media industry as a whole.

190,"Although almost one in three U.S. households shops on a budget, it remains unclear whether and how shoppers track their in-store spending to stay within those budgets. A field study and two laboratory studies offer four key generalizations about budget shoppers in grocery stores: (1) They predominantly use mental computation strategies to track their in-store spending, (2) they adapt their mental computation strategy to the dominant range of price endings of items in their shopping baskets, (3) those who try to calculate the exact total price of their basket are less accurate than those who estimate the approximate price, and (4) motivated shoppers are less accurate than less motivated shoppers (because they tend to calculate rather than estimate the total basket price). A second field study demonstrates that shoppers who underestimate the total price of their basket are more likely to overspend, leading to negative store satisfaction.
","We study the impact of customer preferences on the purchase of a product. We use a data set of 1,976 retail stores in the United States to study the effect of customer preferences on the purchase of a product. We find that customers who prefer to buy a product at a lower price are more likely to purchase a product at a higher price. We also find that customers who prefer to buy a product at a higher price are more likely to purchase a product at a lower price. We also find that customers who prefer to buy a product at a lower price are more likely to purchase a product at a higher price.

191,"Governance theories, such as transaction cost economics, argue that systematic deviations from an attribute–governance alignment should influence performance. This article investigates the performance implications of contract specificity for the procurement of information technology products. The authors argue that parties choose a level of contract specificity that economizes on both the ex ante contracting costs and the ex post transaction costs and that deviations between the observed and the predicted levels of contract specificity are an important determinant of these transaction costs. The authors test the hypotheses using a comprehensive archival data set of information technology transactions and employ a two-step estimation procedure. First, they estimate the “predicted” level of contract specificity, which accounts for key transactional attributes. Second, they study the consequences of deviating from this predicted level of contractual specificity. The results provide the first explicit demonstration of the trade-off between ex ante contracting costs and ex post transaction problems and suggest that parties need to economize jointly on these costs when choosing the governance form.

192,"Although customized price promotions are increasingly common in the marketplace, relatively little is known about how deal recipients evaluate them. The authors investigate the role of a promotional characteristic that has received little attention in the literature by examining whether consumers’ responsiveness to a targeted discount is influenced by their perceptions of the deal's exclusivity (i.e., the degree to which the offer is available only to them or to other consumers as well). The results demonstrate that exclusive promotions may be viewed more, equally, or less favorably than inclusive offers, depending on several factors used in decisions about the delivery of targeted offers (e.g., customer demographics, transactional histories). Specifically, the authors find that exclusive deals are favored over inclusive offers (Study 1), a preference that is pronounced for consumers adopting independent self-construals (Study 2) and for male consumers with a history of purchasing from the marketer providing the offer (Study 3). These exclusivity effects are mediated by the ability of the promotional offer to allow consumers to engage in self-enhancement (Study 3).
","We examine the impact of consumer choice on the purchase of a product. We examine the effect of consumer choice on the purchase of a product in two settings: (1) a consumer who is not a consumer and (2) a consumer who is not a consumer. We find that consumers who are not consumers are more likely to purchase a product when the product is offered by a firm that offers a higher level of quality. We also find that consumers who are not consumers are more likely to purchase a product when the product is offered by a firm that offers a higher level of quality. We also find that consumers who are not consumers are more likely to purchase a product when the product is offered by a firm that offers a higher level of quality. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of consumer choice and the design of consumer-specific pricing policies.

193,"This article examines how product and consumer characteristics moderate the influence of online consumer reviews on product sales using data from the video game industry. The findings indicate that online reviews are more influential for less popular games and games whose players have greater Internet experience. The article shows differential impact of consumer reviews across products in the same product category and suggests that firms’ online marketing strategies should be contingent on product and consumer characteristics. The authors discuss the implications of these results in light of the increased share of niche products in recent years.

194,"A qualitative study of subsistence consumer–merchants (SCMs) in Chennai, India, reveals that they sustain relationships in three interdependent relationship domains: vendor, customer, and family. Relying on long interview data, the authors interpret the subsystems as closed-loop and self-sustaining relationships. Subsystems are managed by SCMs through buying and selling activities alongside the receiving and granting of credit, and these activities engender three facets of commitment: continuance, affective, and normative. Different facets of commitment underlie the relationships in the three subsystems. Through different role-based activities, SCMs enhance or diminish commitment levels to keep all three types of relationships viable while moving their scarce time, energy, and financial resources into the domain with the greatest need. Activities and the management of commitment are performed within 24-hour business cycles, with negligible resources, and in highly unstable environments, providing valuable theoretical insights and managerial implications that guide recommendations for firms wanting to serve subsistence markets successfully.

195,"Audience measures serve as the basis on which billions of dollars of television advertising are purchased each year. However, these measures often fall short of providing marketers and media planners with information about the size of the audience that has the opportunity to see advertisements during commercial breaks. Although program audience measures remain relevant for product placement, the size of the gap between the audience potentially exposed to programming and the audience exposed to commercial breaks has implications for advertisers and networks, affecting decisions such as program selection and ad pricing. The authors use a full television season of live tuning data to study variation across programs in the size of the program audience and the size of the gap between the potential program audiences and the potential commercial audiences, which is found to exceed 20% of the program audience in some cases. Across program genres, the authors find that dramas have increased program popularity and reduced ad avoidance, whereas reality television experiences increased ad avoidance. The analysis reveals the importance of incorporating show-specific random effects because their omission can result in spurious attribution of differences in ad avoidance and program popularity to genre. The authors discuss the implications for networks and advertisers.

196,"Recent research has suggested that consumers have in-store slack for grocery trips—that is, they leave room in their mental budgets to make unplanned purchases. Drawing on this work, this article examines how the impact of promotions depends on whether the shopper still has in-store slack remaining in his or her mental budget. Specifically, the authors evaluate how the effect of promotional savings for both planned and unplanned items on spending varies as a function of whether the item is purchased before or after the shopper's in-store slack is depleted. In addition, they examine how these relationships vary depending on income. To achieve these goals, the authors conducted a field study in which respondents used a handheld scanner to record the order of purchases. The results suggest that savings on planned items lead to stockpiling by higher-income shoppers when the savings occur before the in-store slack has been depleted but lead to increased purchase of unplanned items when they occur after in-store slack is depleted. The results also show that promotions on unplanned grocery items generate incremental spending at the basket level, which increases with income but only when the item is purchased after the in-store slack is exceeded.

197,"Emergent perspectives in marketing highlight new opportunities for co-opting customers as a means to define and cocreate value through their participation. This study delineates and empirically tests hypotheses regarding the effects of customer participation (CP) on value creation and satisfaction for both customers and employees with different cultural value orientations in the context of professional financial services. Using data collected from 349 pairs of customers and service employees in two national groups (Hong Kong and the United States) of a global financial institution, this study examines how (1) CP drives performance outcomes (i.e., customer satisfaction, employee job satisfaction, and employee job performance) through the creation of economic and relational values and (2) the effects of CP on value creation depend on participants’ cultural value orientations. Promoting CP could be a double-edged sword for firms: CP enhances customers’ economic value attainment and strengthens the relational bond between customers and employees, but it also increases employees’ job stress and hampers their job satisfaction. Moreover, the effects of CP on value creation depend on the cultural values of both customers and service employees; this result implies that arranging customers and service employees with “matched” cultural value orientations could facilitate the creation of value through CP.
",We examine the role of social capital (SCC) in the development of a customer-centric business model. We examine the role of SCC in the development of a customer-centric business model by examining the role of customer-centric business model (CBD) in the development of a customer-centric business model. We find that the role of customer-centric business model (CBD) in the development of a customer-centric business model is positively related to the level of customer-centric business model (CBD) and the level of customer-centric business model (CBD) in the customer-centric business model.

198,"This study empirically examines the longitudinal influences of salesperson goal orientations on performance trajectories during a planned change intervention that requires learning to answer two questions. First, what is the functional form of salespeople's performance trajectories during a period of change implementation? Second, why are some salespeople better at adapting to change than others? Polynomial growth models show that the average salesperson performance trajectory displays an initial decline, gradual recovery, and eventual restabilization. Salesperson learning orientation is related positively to larger initial declines, steeper recovery slopes, and higher restabilization levels. In contrast, performance orientation is related positively to smaller initial declines, but shallower recovery slopes and lower restabilization levels. The results suggest that successful implementation of planned change interventions largely depends on identifying and appreciating the heterogeneity of individual traits that share meaning with the change. The study has implications on what sales managers should expect in terms of performance losses and gains during change and how managers can predict which salespeople will reap the largest performance benefits from a change intervention.

199,"Why are some brands more elastic than others? Prior research shows that consumers are more accepting of extensions into distant product categories for brands with prestige concepts (Rolex) than for brands with functional concepts (Timex). In this article, the authors examine consumers’ style of thinking—analytic versus holistic thinking—to better understand the elasticity of prestige versus functional brands. For functional brands, the authors find that holistic thinkers provide more favorable responses to distant extensions than analytic thinkers; however, for prestige brands, holistic and analytic thinkers respond equally favorably. Thus, analytic thinkers are identified as the roadblocks for functional brands launching distant brand extensions. To meet this challenge, the authors offer several strategies, including (1) using a subbrand (Excer wallets by Toyota) instead of a direct brand (Toyota wallets) to reduce analytic thinking; (2) using elaborational communications, which address potentially problematic features of the extension, to reduce analytic thinking; and (3) matching extension information with the consumer's style of thinking, which increases the persuasiveness of ad messages.

200,"This research examines how school administrators can motivate children to make more healthful food choices using incentives, pledges, and competitions as interventions. A six-month field study was conducted across 55 elementary and middle schools, and the authors analyzed the data using a two-level Bayesian hierarchical linear model. All three interventions increased the choice of fruits and vegetables (the proportion of children choosing additional servings increased 3 to 24 percentage points) ten weeks after the interventions ended. However, younger (Grades 1 and 2) and older (Grades 3–8) children responded differently to the interventions. Although both younger and older children responded more favorably to the competition intervention than to the pledge or incentive interventions, the effects of the competition and incentive interventions were more pronounced among the younger children. A second field study, also with schoolchildren, examined the role of pledge reminders on adherence to the pledge. The presence of a visible reminder of a pledge resulted in significantly better outcomes than no reminder of a pledge.

201,"Fueled by digital distribution, unbundling is prevalent in many information and entertainment industries. What is the effect of this unbundling on sales, and what bundle characteristics drive this effect? The author empirically examines these questions in the context of the music industry, using data on weekly digital-track, digital-album, and physical-album sales from January 2005 to April 2007 for all titles released by a sample of more than 200 artists. The modeling framework, a system of an “album-sales” and a “song-sales” equation estimated with the seemingly unrelated regression method, explicitly accounts for the interaction between sales for the bundle and its components. The findings reveal that revenues decrease significantly as digital downloading becomes more prevalent, but the number of items included in a bundle (a measure of its “objective” value) is not a significant moderator of this effect. Instead, bundles with items that are more equal in their appeal and bundles offered by producers with a strong reputation suffer less from the negative impact of the shift to mixed bundling in online channels.
","We examine the impact of the “price-to-play” (P2P) on the retail price of a product. We find that the price-to-play effect is stronger for products with higher consumer demand and higher product quality. We also find that the price-to-play effect is stronger for products with higher consumer demand and higher product quality. We also find that the price-to-play effect is stronger for products with higher consumer demand and higher product quality. We also find that the price-to-play effect is stronger for products with higher consumer demand and higher product quality. We also find that the price-to-play effect is stronger for products with higher consumer demand and higher product quality. We also find that the price-to-play effect is stronger for products with higher consumer demand and higher product quality. Finally, we find that the price-to-play effect is stronger for products with higher consumer demand and higher product quality.  We discuss the implications of these findings for the retail price of digital goods and the retail price of digital services.  10/29/17  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \",0.6567131,-0.67639697,-0.10300053,-0.113056876,0.7208274,-0.3884313,0.46010378,0.24503796,0.713208,-0.6926137,0.104269475,0.35827932,0.16809733,-0.012761939,-1.2859396,0.34045056,0.06440258,-0.76119244,0.38240612,-1.082656,-0.97023183,-1.1521759,0.57826537,-0.045491822,-0.3767085,-0.6661888,-0.025642365,0.45442107,0.5184972,0.19748217,-0.6539998,-1.4515173,-1.5500846,-1.7369741,-0.4360471,0.101691715,0.39033568,-0.36441922,-1.2623409,-0.8713713,0.12662655,-1.2088162,0.6156226,-0.4569417,0.454802,0.35896966,-0.79907614,0.040437598,-0.62364703,0.87991333,0.5024749,-0.40203598,-1.5832102,0.6026596,-0.092199996,0.63214695,0.7678998,0.27095208,-0.17537796,-0.5158391,-1.0318689,0.7680851,0.9833721,0.047945052,-0.90552837,-0.36060345,-0.22392954,-0.5375888,0.8030863,1.3176106,-0.39654544,-0.30673316,0.5839377,-2.2668672,-0.33650512,-0.15577771,-0.4168714,0.83915484,-0.52327484,-0.62348616,1.4326959,-0.94189095,0.65076417,1.7034733,-0.4004806,0.6979902,-0.37828237,-0.6837968,-0.3131249,-0.46226257,0.87335604,0.19996086,-0.8335612,1.3118389,0.518482,0.30270243,-0.32412285,-1.1543736,1.2803385,0.029689593,-0.56494325,0.5870368,-0.11351541,-0.15559605,0.38553485,0.38258713,0.49530232,0.8433755,0.05433009,0.21168926,0.0972535,-0.3629486,1.6597834,-0.41149253,0.02322678,0.49581105,0.28291517,0.606532,0.6578468,1.333404,0.22317833,-0.4721662,-0.48819515,1.041893,-0.72913986,0.0098568145,-0.41055864,-0.9488328
202,"This article proposes a new conceptual framework in which the impact of network effects (NE) on a pioneer's survival advantage compared with its early followers can be positive or negative depending on two important but previously ignored market characteristics: (1) cross-generation product compatibility and (2) within-generation product compatibility. The authors empirically test the theoretical predictions using data from 45 NE markets. They show that these two types of compatibility affect the pioneer's survival advantage in opposite directions and that such directions are reversed when NE changes from extremely strong to extremely weak. Specifically, in markets with strong NE, cross-generation incompatibility harms but within-generation incompatibility favors the pioneer's survival advantage. Consequently, pioneers are likely to enjoy a survival advantage when their product is cross-generation compatible but within-generation incompatible. However, in markets with weak NE, pioneer survival advantage is likely to occur under opposite conditions (i.e., cross-generation incompatible but within-generation compatible). The policy analysis further suggests that the best survival condition for pioneers often turns out to be the worst for followers in these markets.

203,"This research introduces “brand prominence,” a construct reflecting the conspicuousness of a brand's mark or logo on a product. The authors propose a taxonomy that assigns consumers to one of four groups according to their wealth and need for status, and they demonstrate how each group's preference for conspicuously or inconspicuously branded luxury goods corresponds predictably with their desire to associate or dissociate with members of their own and other groups. Wealthy consumers low in need for status want to associate with their own kind and pay a premium for quiet goods only they can recognize. Wealthy consumers high in need for status use loud luxury goods to signal to the less affluent that they are not one of them. Those who are high in need for status but cannot afford true luxury use loud counterfeits to emulate those they recognize to be wealthy. Field experiments along with analysis of market data (including counterfeits) support the proposed model of status signaling using brand prominence.

204,"Risk disclosure is an essential element of the marketing of prescription drugs and other medical products. This study examines how consumers respond to verbal information about the frequency and severity of medical-product risks and how media-induced affect can moderate such responses. The study finds that consumers tend to overestimate the actual likelihood of adverse events described with words such as “common” or “rare” (compared with the probabilities such terms are typically intended to convey) and that consumers tend to give little weight to such probability language when forming product use intentions. However, consumers in positive media-induced moods seem to engage in more nuanced evaluation of product risk information, weighing both frequency and severity information and using such information to make inferences about other product attributes (e.g., product efficacy). These findings suggest that medical marketers and regulators need to devise more effective means of communicating risk probability to consumers and that positive mood induction (e.g., by placing advertisements in upbeat media environments) can enhance consumers’ ability to process product risk information.

205,"Rather than relying on traditional relational exchanges, recent technological advances have made it feasible for firms to undertake market-based transactions through information technology–mediated electronic markets. The success of such business-to-business electronic markets depends on the governance practices of the market maker—that is, the firm that manages and administers the electronic market. Market makers use three governance mechanisms to manage electronic markets: (1) monitoring the market participants (i.e., buyers and sellers that participate in the market), (2) building a sense of community among market participants to instill mutual respect and trust, and (3) self-participating in the electronic market to build know-how about how the market functions. Building on transaction cost analysis theory, the authors suggest that the influence of these governance mechanisms on electronic market performance (i.e., meeting strategic and financial objectives) depends on behavioral and external uncertainty in the market. Survey data from market makers show that (1) monitoring is effective for reputed market makers and when demand uncertainty is high, (2) community building is beneficial when pricing is static rather than dynamic, and (3) self-participation is useful when the market maker is well reputed and when the market relies on dynamic pricing.

206,"Service literature has implicitly assumed that frontline employees (FLEs) share a common understanding of the term “customer service.” Perhaps because of this assumption, differences in FLE attitudes, behaviors, and performance have been ascribed to organizational characteristics, social environment, job characteristics, or personality. This article shows that FLEs’ interpretations of customer service also matter. Using qualitative and quantitative data, this study finds that three distinct interpretations of customer service, or service models, exist among retail FLEs: (1) the act of giving customers what they ask for, efficiently and courteously; (2) a means to accomplishing immediate objectives, such as sales quotas; and (3) the formation of mutually beneficial relationships with customers through problem solving. Service models are related to FLEs’ customer orientation, competence, surface and deep acting, and interpersonal values. The findings indicate that differences in FLEs’ attitudes, behaviors, and performance can arise from their keeping of different service models; illuminate individual-level beliefs underlying service typologies, such as goods- and service-dominant logic; and suggest that FLE recruitment and training should take service models into account.

207,"A manufacturer's success in the marketplace is contingent in part on its ability to energize its downstream channel members in support of its brands. Gaining the focused effort of the reseller's sales personnel is particularly important, and this has become increasingly challenging as resellers broaden their brand portfolios in the wake of industry consolidation. This study reveals a motivating influence that can potentially be harnessed by both manufacturer and channel member: identification. Using a multilevel analysis, the authors explore the sometimes conflicting impact of salesperson brand identification, salesperson organizational identification, and manufacturer–channel member control system alignment on brand and channel member sales performance. The authors also examine favorable extra-role consequences of salesperson brand identification. The results show that while organizational identification strengthens salesperson adherence to controls, brand identification can increase salesperson effort behind a specific brand, and ultimately improved brand performance, even in the face of control systems to the contrary. This suggests that suppliers can exercise influence over the reseller's sales force by strengthening the psychological connection between their brands and reseller sales personnel.

208,"Recent research has demonstrated that linguistic characteristics of brand names can cognitively affect product evaluations. In six experiments, the authors demonstrate that affect arising from sound repetition may also be influential. The results reveal across multiple brand names and product categories that exposure to a brand name that has sound repetition in its phonetic structure and is spoken aloud produces positive affect, which favorably affects consumers’ brand evaluations, reactions to cross-selling, and product choice. The effects are moderated by consumers’ sensitivity to repetition, consumers’ opportunity to experience emotions, and the degree to which the brand name's phonetic sound repetition deviates from linguistic expectations. The authors discuss implications for managers and avenues for further research.

209,"This article introduces and empirically tests a conceptual model of the key determinants of the profitability of bundling in auction markets. The model encapsulates hypotheses about how seller revenue from the combined (i.e., bundle) auction of component products relative to that from separate auctions of the components is influenced by the heterogeneity in bidders’ product valuations, the degree of complementarity between component products, the particular multi-item selling strategy, and the outside availability of the products. The results of three field experiments show that though bundle auctions tend to be less profitable for noncomplementary and substitute products, they are on average 50% more profitable than separate auctions when there is (even only moderate) complementarity between the component products. The latter effect is greater when the bundle and the separate components are offered at different times, and it is more pronounced for services than for tangible goods. The findings also identify conditions under which each of the essential multi-item selling strategies for fixed-price settings (pure components, pure bundling, and mixed bundling) tends to maximize seller revenue in auctions.

210,"Many firms are now using referral marketing campaigns to harness the power of word of mouth and to increase referrals to acquire new customers. Prior research has identified a method of computing the value of referrals using only a customer's actual past referral behavior to compute customer referral value (CRV). In this article, the authors develop and test a new four-step approach to compute CRV. In addition, they determine the behavioral drivers of CRV and then identify the most effective methods of targeting the most promising customers on the basis of their customer lifetime value (CLV) and CRV scores. The authors illustrate and test this approach through four separate field experiments with firms from two industries: financial services and retailing. They find that to maximize profitability, it is critical to manage customers in terms of both their CLV and CRV scores and that understanding the behavioral drivers of CRV can help managers better target the most profitable customers with their referral marketing campaigns.

211,"Manufacturers are increasingly producing and promoting sustainable products (i.e., products that have a positive social and/or environmental impact). However, relatively little is known about how product sustainability affects consumers’ preferences. The authors propose that sustainability may not always be an asset, even if most consumers care about social and environmental issues. The degree to which sustainability enhances preference depends on the type of benefit consumers most value for the product category in question. In this research, the authors demonstrate that consumers associate higher product ethicality with gentleness-related attributes and lower product ethicality with strength-related attributes. As a consequence of these associations, the positive effect of product sustainability on consumer preferences is reduced when strength-related attributes are valued, sometimes even resulting in preferences for less sustainable product alternatives (i.e., the “sustainability liability”). Conversely, when gentleness-related attributes are valued, sustainability enhances preference. In addition, the authors show that the potential negative impact of sustainability on product preferences can be attenuated using explicit cues about product strength.

212,"Ensuring joint program participation by distributors is essential to channel management. Although studies confirm that firms can promote distributor participation by attending to their participation motivations, the authors argue that distributors may change their motivations over the course of a joint program, driven by an increase of program-related information and how their peer distributors behave. Drawing insights from the information asymmetry literature, the authors postulate that distributors’ ex ante commitment is driven by their motivation to avoid losses, and after they participate, their ex post adaptation reflects rent-seeking motivations. This study also examines how the participation of peer distributors operates as an information signal that moderates the motivation–participation link for the focal distributor. In the context of an actual sales program, this study confirms the postulate of motivation shift and the salience of network-based information in distributors’ program participation. The results show that a manufacturer needs to manage its distributors’ participation in a discriminant, process-oriented, and system-sensitive manner by addressing the latter's diverse motivations, changing goals in the joint program, and influences from peer distributors.

213,"Advertising needs to capture consumers’ attention in likable ways, and the visual complexity of advertising plays a central role in this regard. Yet ideas about visual complexity effects conflict, and objective measures of complexity are rare. The authors distinguish two types of visual complexity, differentiate them from the difficulty of comprehending advertising, and propose objective measures for each. Advertisements are visually complex when they contain dense perceptual features (“feature complexity”) and/or when they have an elaborate creative design (“design complexity”). An analysis of 249 advertisements that were tested with eye-tracking shows that, as the authors hypothesize, feature complexity hurts attention to the brand and attitude toward the ad, whereas design complexity helps attention to both the pictorial and the advertisement as a whole, its comprehensibility, and attitude toward the ad. This is important because design complexity is under direct control of the advertiser. The proposed measures can be readily adopted to assess the visual complexity of advertising, and the findings can be used to improve the stopping power of advertisements.

214,"This study examines the diffusion of market orientation (MO) as a social learning process to acquire and transfer individual-level MO. Central to the diffusion are important work-group members, or envoys. Through their market-oriented action, top managers serve as market-oriented role models to two important types of observers in work groups—formal middle managers and work-group expert peers. In turn, these observers become top managers’ envoys and role models of market-oriented behavior to frontline employees. Empirical results from a three-level data set from a Fortune 500 company support this perspective. While envoys who are neither market oriented nor identified with the firm are the least effective, envoys who are not market oriented but are strongly identified with the firm are also detrimental. Network size hinders the informal route of learning through expert peers but not the formal route through middle managers. By identifying who the important work-group envoys are and under what conditions certain envoys are likely to be most effective, this study helps managers select the best envoys to implement MO.

215,"Prior research has identified the integration of marketing with research and development (R&D) as a key success factor for new product development (NPD). However, prior work has not distinguished the sales and marketing functions, even though they are distinctive departments within an organization. Therefore, the authors extend prior research and examine the effect of cross-functional cooperation among sales, marketing, and R&D on NPD performance across multiple stages of the NPD process. The authors use multiple-informant data from 424 sales, marketing, and R&D managers as well as project leaders of 106 NPD projects to test several hypotheses. The results show that the cooperation between sales and R&D and between sales and marketing has a significant, positive effect on overall NPD project performance beyond marketing–R&D cooperation. The authors also find that the effect of cross-functional cooperation among sales, marketing, and R&D on overall NPD project performance varies across stages of the NPD process. More specifically, the authors find that sales–R&D cooperation in the concept and product development stages is critical for greater new product success. Sales–marketing cooperation is important in the concept development stage but has surprisingly less impact in the implementation stage.
","We investigate the impact of product quality on the performance of a firm’s product development teams. We conducted a field experiment with a large U.S. manufacturer and found that the quality of the product development team (PDT) is positively related to the quality of the product development team (PDT) and the quality of the product development team (PDT) in the presence of product quality. The PDT is more likely to develop products with higher quality than the PDT, and the quality of the product development team (PDT) is more likely to develop products with lower quality than the PDT. The results of the field experiment suggest that the PDT is more likely to develop products with higher quality than the PDT, and the quality of the product development team (PDT) is more likely to develop products with lower quality than the PDT. The results also suggest that the PDT is more likely to develop products with higher quality than the PDT, and the quality of the product development team (PDT) is more likely to develop products with lower quality than the PDT.

216,"In this article, the authors find that consumers’ preferences change as a function of their temporal distance from the receipt of their last salary. The authors propose and test that when consumers have just received their salary (“the near-salary condition”), they exhibit promotion motivations in their product preferences. However, they exhibit prevention motivations in their product preferences when significant time has elapsed since their last salary receipt (“the far-from-salary condition”). The authors collected data from two longitudinal studies to validate these findings and to test the underlying process. Using actual purchase behavior and collecting product preference during a one-month period, the authors show that consumers’ product preferences change in response to temporal distance from their last salary receipt. The findings suggest to managers that the best time to promote products or messages with a promotion appeal is near to consumers’ last salary receipt and that the best time to promote products or messages with a prevention appeal is far from consumers’ last salary receipt.

217,"The authors compare three mechanisms that may explain why older consumers tend to prefer older brands. Data are from the French perfume market, in which some market leaders are decades old while hundreds of new entrants launch yearly. The authors reveal monotonically increasing differences across age ranges. Younger consumers have a greater propensity to change their preferred brand, a form of innovativeness that benefits relatively recent entrants, whereas older consumers exhibit a propensity to remain attached for a longer duration to the same preferred brand. Nostalgia for options encountered during an early “formative period” has only a limited impact. Furthermore, strong heterogeneity emerges: At all ages, some consumers frequently change their preferred brand, whereas others remain attached to it for long periods. It is the proportion of these two behaviors that varies across age ranges. The resultant managerial implications indicate that mature consumers are attractive targets because they likely remain attached to a brand longer, that long-established products may still attract new consumers, and that the success of a new brand among young consumers may be ephemeral.
","We examine the impact of a new product on consumers’ purchase decisions. We find that consumers who purchase a new product are more likely to purchase a new product when the new product is more expensive. However, consumers who purchase a new product are more likely to purchase a new product when the new product is more expensive. We also find that consumers who purchase a new product are more likely to purchase a new product when the new product is more expensive. We also find that consumers who purchase a new product are more likely to purchase a new product when the new product is more expensive. We also find that consumers who purchase a new product are more likely to purchase a new product when the new product is more expensive. Finally, we find that consumers who purchase a new product are more likely to purchase a new product when the new product is more expensive. These findings provide new insights into the dynamics of consumer choice and the dynamics of product availability.  We also discuss the implications of these findings for the design of new product introductions and the design of new product introductions.

218,"Research has not verified the theoretical or practical value of the brand attachment construct in relation to alternative constructs, particularly brand attitude strength. The authors make conceptual, measurement, and managerial contributions to this research issue. Conceptually, they define brand attachment, articulate its defining properties, and differentiate it from brand attitude strength. From a measurement perspective, they develop and validate a parsimonious measure of brand attachment, test the assumptions that underlie it, and demonstrate that it indicates the concept of attachment. They also demonstrate the convergent and discriminant validity of this measure in relation to brand attitude strength. Managerially, they demonstrate that brand attachment offers value over brand attitude strength in predicting (1) consumers’ intentions to perform difficult behaviors (those they regard as using consumer resources), (2) actual purchase behaviors, (3) brand purchase share (the share of a brand among directly competing brands), and (4) need share (the extent to which consumers rely on a brand to address relevant needs, including those brands in substitutable product categories).

219,"In this article, the authors introduce attitude toward global products (AGP) and attitude toward local products (ALP) as generalized attitudinal constructs and address the four issues these constructs raise: (1) How are AGP and ALP related to each other? (2) What is the motivational structure underlying AGP and ALP? (3) Is the proposed theory culturally circumscribed, or does it generalize across countries? and (4) What are the managerially relevant implications of these consumer attitudes? To answer these questions, the authors propose and empirically test an integrated structure for AGP and ALP and their antecedents, organized around the powerful motivational concept of values. They test their theory using a unique data set involving 13,000 respondents from 28 countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, thus allowing for a global investigation of a global issue. The study findings provide managers with strategic direction on how to market their products in a globalized world.
",The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of organizational and social factors in the development of the concept of organizational value (OMV) and its implications for the development of OMV. We propose that organizational value is defined as the value of a product or service that is perceived as superior to other products or services. We propose that OMV is defined as the value of a product or service that is perceived as superior to other products or services. We also propose that OMV is defined as the value of a product or service that is perceived as superior to other products or services. We also propose that OMV is defined as the value of a product or service that is perceived as superior to other products or services.

220,"Embedded premium (EP) promotions promise purchase-contingent donations to a social cause and are typically studied within a single category. However, EP programs spanning multiple product categories and brands are widespread. This research investigates fundamental questions regarding where and to what extent an EP promotion should be used in multicategory contexts. Using experimental choice data from more than 3500 people in two studies, the authors examine multicategory EP programs in two distinct branding environments: spanning a diverse house-of-brands portfolio or covering a multicategory product line that shares a common corporate brand name. For the corporate brand context, the results show that EP effects in one category carry over to adjacent categories that do not have an EP association. Greater multicategory EP prevalence does not enhance brand attractiveness beyond the effect of a single EP exposure. For the house-of-brands context, there is an inverse relationship between brand strength and incremental gain from EP. From a return-on-investment standpoint, EP promotions are more efficient than price promotions because they enhance brand preference and are relatively cheaper to deploy. The results make a strong case for a more discriminating implementation of EP programs across brands and categories.
","We study the impact of product differentiation on the value of a product in a multilevel setting. We examine the impact of product differentiation on the value of a product in a multilevel setting by examining the relationship between product differentiation and the value of a product in a multilevel setting. We find that differentiation increases the value of a product by increasing the number of products in the product category, but it also increases the value of a product by decreasing the number of products in the product category. We also find that differentiation increases the value of a product by increasing the number of products in the product category, but it also increases the value of a product by decreasing the number of products in the product category.

221,"This research explores the relative influence of salespeople's attitudes toward selling a new product, perceptions of subjective norms, and self-efficacy on the development of selling intentions and, ultimately, the success of a new product launch. The longitudinal study employs a nonlinear growth curve model that leverages survey data from industrial salespeople and objective performance records of their daily sales during the first several months in the market of two new products: a new-to-market product and a line extension. By examining salesperson-level variance on new product performance, the authors suggest that managers should focus on increasing salesperson self-efficacy and positive attitudes toward selling the product to build selling intentions and quickly grow new product performance. They also suggest that sales managers should resist the temptation to rely on normative pressure during a new product introduction. Not only are subjective norms less effective in building selling intentions, but they also diminish the positive impact of attitudes and self-efficacy on salesperson intentions and constrain the positive relationships between intentions and performance and self-efficacy and performance.

222,"This research examines a firm's performance in an international marketing alliance when it responds to a self-serving partner's exploitive behavior with accommodation, a cooperative response motivated by the firm's commitment to the venture. The authors theorize that a wronged firm's payoff from accommodation depends on its approach to monitoring, either employing overt surveillance or relying on its partner's self-control. Overt surveillance is believed to undermine accommodation's ability to convince a selfish partner that cooperation is beneficial and not inconsistent with its self-interest. In contrast, because no or low monitoring is a relational approach to evaluation, it tends to reinforce accommodation, persuading a competitive partner to reciprocate cooperatively. Data collected from 174 international marketing alliances support the authors’ prediction that under low monitoring, accommodation is positively associated with performance in the alliance. Unexpectedly, under high monitoring, performance is greatest under both low and high accommodation. An explanation may lie in accommodation theory's notion that as accommodation increases, a selfish partner transitions from competition to cooperation, ceasing to exploit accommodation and upturning performance.
","We examine the role of intermediaries in the negotiation of a contract between a firm and a third party. We find that intermediaries are more likely to negotiate a contract with a firm when the firm is a firm with a high level of internal competition. However, intermediaries are less likely to negotiate a contract with a firm when the firm is a firm with a low level of internal competition. We also find that intermediaries are more likely to negotiate a contract with a firm when the firm is a firm with a low level of internal competition. We also find that intermediaries are more likely to negotiate a contract with a firm when the firm is a firm with a high level of internal competition. We also find that intermediaries are more likely to negotiate a contract with a firm when the firm is a firm with a low level of internal competition.

223,"Marketing planners often use geographical information systems (GISs) to help identify suitable retail locations, regionally distribute advertising campaigns, and target direct marketing activities. Geographical information systems thematic maps facilitate the visual assessment of map regions. A broad set of alternative symbolizations, such as circles, bars, or shading, can be used to visually represent quantitative geospatial data on such maps. However, there is little knowledge on which kind of symbolization is the most adequate in which problem situation. In a large-scale experimental study, the authors show that the type of symbolization strongly influences decision performance. The findings indicate that graduated circles are appropriate symbolizations for geographical information systems thematic maps, and their successful utilization seems to be virtually independent of personal characteristics, such as spatial ability and map experience. This makes circle symbolizations particularly suitable for effective decision making and cross-functional communication.

224,"Customer satisfaction is universally acknowledged as a key driver of customer repurchase behavior, but recent evidence suggests that satisfaction has no effect on repurchase under certain circumstances. In this study, the authors develop a framework for understanding the complex relationships among satisfaction, moderating variables, and repurchase. They propose that the satisfaction–repurchase link is subject to complementary and substitute effects and present satiation and inertia as key theoretical mechanisms that explain and predict those effects. In weak-satiation purchase categories, complementary effects are more likely, which suggests that managers should invest in customer satisfaction and complementary initiatives simultaneously. In strong-satiation purchase categories, substitute effects are more likely, which suggests that managers should invest in either customer satisfaction or substitute initiatives. An empirical test combining survey and longitudinal purchase data from two categories—fashion apparel and automobile service—provides a remarkable degree of support for the propositions. The findings offer new theoretical insights and substantive guidance for managers to effectively allocate resources to initiatives that complement or substitute for customer satisfaction.

225,"There has been little research on how market disruptions affect customer–brand relationships and how firms can sustain brand loyalty when disruptions occur. Drawing from social identity theory and the brand loyalty literature, the authors propose a conceptual framework to examine these issues in a specific market disruption, namely, the introduction of a radically new brand. The framework focuses on the time-varying effects of customers’ identification with and perceived value of the incumbent relative to the new brand on switching behavior. The authors divert from the conventional economic perspective of treating brand switching as functional utility maximization to propose that brand switching can also result from customers’ social mobility between brand identities. The results from longitudinal data of 679 customers during the launch of the iPhone in Spain show that both relative customer–brand identification and relative perceived value of the incumbent inhibit switching behavior, but their effects vary over time. Relative customer–brand identification with the incumbent apparently exerts a stronger longitudinal restraint on switching behavior than relative perceived value of the incumbent. The study has important strategic implications for devising customer relationship strategies and brand investment.

226,"Despite increasing attention to the role of social ties in emerging economies, few studies have explicitly distinguished the differential roles of business versus political ties. Drawing on relational governance and institutional theories, this study offers a contingent view of business and political ties in China. The findings from a survey of 241 Chinese firms indicate that business ties have a stronger positive effect on performance than political ties, and both effects depend on institutional and market environments. Business ties are more beneficial when legal enforcement is inefficient and technology is changing rapidly, whereas political ties lead to greater performance when general government support is weak and technological turbulence is low. These findings indicate that firms operating in China should be cautious in their use of business and political ties and adapt their tie utilization to changing institutional and market environments.

227,"The authors use panel data constructed from the responses of repeatedly surveyed top managers at 261 companies regarding their firm's market orientation, along with objective performance measures, to investigate the influence of market orientation on performance for a nine-year period from 1997 to 2005. The authors measure market orientation in 1997, 2001, and 2005 and estimate it in the interval between these measurement periods. The analyses indicate that market orientation has a positive effect on business performance in both the short and the long run. However, the sustained advantage in business performance from having a market orientation is greater for the firms that are early to develop a market orientation. These firms also gain more in sales and profit than firms that are late in developing a market orientation. Firms that adopt a market orientation may also realize additional benefit in the form of a lift in sales and profit due to a carryover effect. Market orientation should have a more pronounced effect on a firm's profit than sales because a market orientation focuses efforts on customer retention rather than on acquisition. Environmental turbulence and competitive intensity moderate the main effect of market orientation on business performance, but the moderating effects are greater in the 1990s than in the 2000s.

228,"Many retailers believe that a majority of purchases are unplanned, so they spend heavily on in-store marketing to stimulate these types of purchases. At the same time, the effects of “preshopping” factors—the shoppers’ overall trip goals, store-specific shopping objectives, and prior marketing exposures—are largely unexplored. The authors focus on these out-of-store drivers and, unlike prior research, use panel data to “hold the shopper constant” while estimating unbiased trip-level effects. Thus, they uncover opportunities for retailers to generate more unplanned buying from existing shoppers. The authors find that the amount of unplanned buying increases monotonically with the abstractness of the overall shopping trip goal that is established before the shopper enters the store. Store-linked goals also affect unplanned buying; unplanned buying is higher on trips in which the shopper chooses the store for favorable pricing and lower on trips in which the shopper chooses the store as part of a multistore shopping trip. Although out-of-store marketing has no direct effect, it reinforces the lift in unplanned buying from shoppers who use marketing materials inside the store. The authors discuss the implications for retailers.

229,"Referral programs have become a popular way to acquire customers. Yet there is no evidence to date that customers acquired through such programs are more valuable than other customers. The authors address this gap and investigate the extent to which referred customers are more profitable and more loyal. Tracking approximately 10,000 customers of a leading German bank for almost three years, the authors find that referred customers (1) have a higher contribution margin, though this difference erodes over time; (2) have a higher retention rate, and this difference persists over time; and (3) are more valuable in both the short and the long run. The average value of a referred customer is at least 16% higher than that of a nonreferred customer with similar demographics and time of acquisition. However, the size of the value differential varies across customer segments; therefore, firms should use a selective approach for their referral programs.

230,"Some chief marketing officers (CMOs) are more powerful than others. The authors investigate the drivers and outcomes of this phenomenon using a hierarchical measure of power for the CMO in the top management team (TMT), or corporate executive suite (C-suite). Theory suggests that CMO power in the TMT should increase with (1) the CMO's control over resources required by other executives in the C-suite, (2) the criticality and (3) effective provision of these resources, and (4) the nonsubstitutability and (5) centrality of the CMO. The authors use these rationales to identify factors that affect CMO power in public U.S. firms with the CMO position for at least two of the five observed years. The findings show that CMO power increases when the CMO has the additional responsibility of sales, as TMT marketing experience decreases, and as firms with low levels of TMT marketing experience pursue innovation. Furthermore, CMO power in highly divisionalized TMTs and the CMO's additional responsibility of sales improve sales growth, but CMO power in firms that are unrelated diversifiers reduces profitability. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results for marketing's influence in the C-suite and the firm, the integration of marketing and sales, and market orientation.

231,"This research examines how sales professionals use emotions in marketing exchanges to facilitate positive outcomes for their firms, themselves, and their customers. The authors conduct three field studies to examine the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) in marketing exchanges on sales performance and customer relationships. They find that EI is positively related to performance of real estate and insurance agents, even when controlling for the effects of domain-general EI, self-report EI, cognitive ability, and several control variables. Sales professionals with higher EI are not only superior revenue generators but also better at retaining customers. In addition, the authors demonstrate that EI interacts with key marketing exchange variables—customer orientation and manifest influence—to heighten performance such that high-EI salespeople more effectively employ customer-oriented selling and influence customer decisions. Finally, the results indicate a complementary relationship between EI and cognitive ability in that EI positively influences performance at higher levels of cognitive ability. These findings have implications for improving interactions between buyers and sellers and for employee selection and training.

232,"Innovation scholars have long touted the value of cross-functional teams, and though firms have embraced a cross-functional design in their new product development (NPD) teams, these teams continue to face challenges. Stability in an NPD team may offer important advantages for decision making; however, its effectiveness as a structural coordination mechanism remains largely unexplored. Therefore, to offer insight into the value of NPD team stability, the authors develop a process-based model that examines the extent to which stability influences certain decision-making processes, which in turn influence new product advantage. They examine these relationships with a sample of cross-functional NPD project teams from 208 high-technology firms. The results reveal that the degree of stability in an NPD project team has a curvilinear relationship to team-level debate and decision-making comprehensiveness. In turn, whereas debate is positively related to decision comprehensiveness, decision comprehensiveness is positively related to new product advantage only at high levels. These curvilinear patterns shed light on anecdotal evidence that currently attributes success to both stable and unstable project teams.

233,"Marketing managers increasingly recognize the need to measure and communicate the impact of their actions on shareholder returns. This study focuses on the shareholder value effects of pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) and direct-to-physician (DTP) marketing efforts. Although DTCA has moderate effects on brand sales and market share, companies invest vast amounts of money in it. Relying on Kalman filtering, the authors develop a methodology to assess the effects from DTCA and DTP on three components of shareholder value: stock return, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Investors value DTCA positively because it leads to higher stock returns and lower systematic risk. Furthermore, DTCA increases idiosyncratic risk, which does not affect investors who maintain well-diversified portfolios. In contrast, DTP marketing has modest positive effects on stock returns and idiosyncratic risk. The outcomes indicate that evaluations of marketing expenditures should include a consideration of the effects of marketing on multiple stakeholders, not just the sales effects on consumers.
",We examine the impact of product-level information on the value of a firm’s stock portfolio. We find that the value of a firm’s stock portfolio is positively related to the firm's expected return on equity (ROE) and the firm's expected return on equity (ROE) on the underlying securities.

234,"This article examines how a manufacturer's governance of an external supplier relationship affects its performance toward a downstream retail customer. In line with sociological and economic theory, a manufacturer's reliance on supplier norms and incentives, respectively, promotes performance. However, the performance effect of each external governance mechanism weakens in the presence of a different governance regime within the manufacturer firm itself. Specifically, internal incentives weaken the effect of external norms, and internal norms weaken the effect of external incentives. From a practical standpoint, these findings point to the difficulty of managing sets of relationships that involve different parties and mechanisms. From a theoretical standpoint, they point to the complex interplay between social norms and economic incentives in driving performance outcomes.

235,"The authors empirically examine the effect of gas prices on grocery shopping behavior using Information Resources Inc. panel data from 2006 to 2008, which track panelists’ purchases of almost 300 product categories across multiple retail formats. The authors quantify the impact on consumers’ total spending and examine the potential avenues for savings when consumers shift from one retail format to another, from national brands to private labels, from regular-priced to promotional products, and from higher to lower price tiers. They find a substantial negative effect on shopping frequency and purchase volume and shifts away from grocery and toward supercenter formats. A greater shift occurs from regular-priced national brands to promoted ones than to private labels, and among national brand purchasers, bottom-tier brands lose share, midtier brands gain share, and top-tier brand share is relatively unaffected. The analysis also controls for general economic conditions and shows that gas prices have a much larger impact on grocery shopping behavior than broad economic factors.

236,"When companies fail to account for collective and relational goals in customer solutions, a mismatch can occur between firms’ solutions and those that customers envision. Understanding the integration processes of customer networks is essential to improving solution design. This investigation draws on depth interviews with 21 families, the focal customer network, to generate collective and relational vacation narratives that contextualize their accounts. The authors identify four customer network integration processes: offerings assembled around prioritized goals, alternate participation, concurrent participation, and offerings assembled around separate coalitions. The findings reveal that the resulting mix of integrated products and services, or the solution, is shaped by customer network identity goals, goal management approaches, and constraints. The authors conclude with recommendations for how firms can use this information to improve solution design, identify new network partners, and revise value propositions.

237,"In today's age of relational selling, a key challenge for salespeople is to determine the degree to which their customer-oriented behaviors drive sales performance. Therefore, this study analyzes whether a salesperson's customer orientation in sales encounters has an optimum level with regard to sales performance and customer attitudes. Using triadic data from a cross-industry survey of 56 sales managers, 195 sales representatives, and 538 customers, the authors provide strong empirical support for a curvilinear, inverted U-shaped effect of a salesperson's customer orientation on sales performance, whereas the effect of customer orientation on customer attitudes is continuously positive. Moreover, the findings reveal that the optimum level of customer orientation with regard to sales performance is higher for salespeople selling individualized products, in firms pursuing a premium price strategy, and in markets with a high degree of competitive intensity.

238,"Four theories on the economic rationale for warranty provision have been proposed in the literature: (1) Warranties provide insurance to customers and work as a risk-sharing mechanism, (2) warranties are a sorting mechanism and work as a means for second-degree price discrimination among customers with different risk preferences, (3) warranties work as a signal of product quality to consumers under information asymmetry, and (4) warranties work as an incentive mechanism for firms to reveal and improve product quality. The authors examine the conditions under which each theory would apply and derive testable implications from the data. They then assess whether these theories have empirical support in the U.S. computer server and automobile markets in the context of manufacturer base warranties. The results indicate that in both markets, warranties primarily provide customers with insurance against product failure, and warranties of different durations work as a sorting mechanism across customers with different levels of risk aversion. Warranties are not used to signal product quality or to provide an incentive for manufacturers to reveal or improve product quality.
",We study the impact of consumer preferences on the quality of a product and its price. We develop a model of consumer preferences that incorporates the consumer's preferences for the product and its price.

239,"As service offerings grow in both range and complexity, how service providers and their customers interact is becoming increasingly important. In response to the challenge of optimizing these interactions, companies have introduced sophisticated online “socialization agents,” whose purpose is to help new customers more effectively adjust to and function within the service environment. The objective of these online agents, or virtual employees, is to help customers evaluate new or unfamiliar service offerings, as well as help companies achieve greater levels of service delivery and financial performance. To investigate this, the authors analyze the process by which online agents help both new and current customers adjust to and function within new, unfamiliar, or complex service contexts. They examine the impact of an online agent on account performance in the banking industry. They find that both interaction style and content of the online agent significantly influence the newcomer adjustment process over time, which in turn influences firm-level performance.

240,"This research demonstrates that as people approach a goal, external representations, which increase the ease of visualizing the goal, enhance goal pursuit. Specifically, consumers judge easy-to-visualize goals to be closer than difficult-to-visualize goals, which in turn increases effort and commitment. Ease of visualization affects performance in swimming competitions and the physical effort exerted in the lab. Visualization also affects commitment toward savings, willingness to wait for service, and performance in a simulated sales task. Importantly, the beneficial effects of visualization exist only when people are close to the goal. In addition, the effect of visualization attenuates when the goal is split into subgoals. Managers can use these results to enhance consumer goal pursuit, influence consumer satisfaction in online service encounters, and motivate employees to improve performance. In these varied contexts, visual representations of goal progress (e.g., progress bars) enhance motivation as people approach their goal.

241,"Consumers’ local bias is an important determinant of domestic product purchase behavior. Because of its importance, authors across various disciplines have investigated this phenomenon using the consumer ethnocentrism model. However, the research reported herein demonstrates that such an approach provides an incomplete picture at best. This research provides an initial test of the consumer disidentification (CDI) construct. In contrast with consumer ethnocentrism, the CDI model predicts that consumers’ repulsion toward their domestic country negatively affects the purchase of products made in their domestic country or by domestic firms. The model is tested using survey data from 1534 second-generation immigrants who were born in and live in the Netherlands. Structural equation modeling supports the model and shows that CDI has a significant impact on buying decisions beyond the effect of consumer ethnocentrism. The results further show that for second-generation Turkish immigrants, acculturation and ethnic identification are important predictors of both consumer ethnocentrism and CDI. The article discusses the implications of these findings for research and practice.

242,"Marketing managers can increase shareholder value by structuring a customer portfolio to reduce the vulnerability and volatility of cash flows. This article demonstrates how financial portfolio theory provides an organizing framework for (1) diagnosing the variability in a customer portfolio, (2) assessing the complementarity/similarity of market segments, (3) exploring market segment weights in an optimized portfolio, and (4) isolating the reward on variability that individual customers or segments provide. Using a seven-year series of customer data from a large business-to-business firm, the authors demonstrate how market segments can be characterized in terms of risk and return. Next, they identify the firm's efficient portfolio and test it against (1) its current portfolio and (2) a hypothetical profit maximization portfolio. Then, using forward- and back-testing, the authors show that the efficient portfolio has consistently lower variability than the existing customer mix and the profit maximization portfolio. The authors provide guidelines for incorporating a risk overlay into established customer management frameworks. The approach is especially well suited for business-to-business firms that serve market segments drawn from diverse sectors of the economy.
","We develop a framework to analyze the value of asset pricing strategies in a portfolio of firms. We develop a model of asset pricing that incorporates the value of asset pricing strategies in a portfolio of firms and show that asset pricing strategies are more valuable than portfolio-specific strategies. We show that asset pricing strategies are more valuable than portfolio-specific strategies in the context of a portfolio of firms with a large number of assets. We also show that asset pricing strategies are more valuable in the context of a portfolio of firms with a large number of assets. We also show that asset pricing strategies are more valuable in the context of a portfolio of firms with a large number of assets.

243,"This article examines the economic worth of product placement in movies over a time span of 40 years (1968–2007). The authors find an inverted U-shaped relationship between the year of the movie release and the returns associated with product placements. In addition, a similar inverted U-shaped relationship characterizes the economic worth of tie-in campaigns associated with product placements. These findings are consistent with the habituation–tedium theory used to explain the inverted U-shaped pattern in response to novel advertisements and suggest that the same mechanism could be influencing the response to an entire marketing medium. Overall, the results reinforce the notion that marketers find it increasingly difficult to get their message across using traditional media and underscore the need for the marketing industry to reinvent itself when new tactics lose their luster. The authors conclude with a discussion of additional empirical regularities.

244,"Whenever a recession occurs, there is a heated dialog among marketing academics and practitioners about the appropriate levels of marketing spending. In this article, the authors investigate whether firms should spend more on research and development (R&D) and advertising in recessions. They propose that the effects of changes in firms’ R&D and advertising spending in recessions on profits and stock returns are contingent on their market share, financial leverage, and product-market profile (i.e., business-to-consumer goods, business-to-business services, business-to-business goods, or business-to-consumer services). They estimate the model using a panel of more than 10,000 firm-years of publicly listed U.S. firms from 1969 to 2008, during which there were seven recessions. Their results support the contingency approach. The authors compute the marginal effects, which show how the effects of changes in R&D and advertising spending in recessions vary across firms. The marginal effects provide evidence of inadequate spending (e.g., 98% of business-to-consumer goods firms underspend on R&D), proactivity (e.g., 96% of business-to-business services firms are at approximately the right levels on advertising). and excess spending (e.g., 92% of business-to-consumer services firms overspend on advertising). Using the authors’ approach and publicly available data, managers can estimate the effects of their firms’ and competitors’ R&D and advertising spending on profits and stock returns in recessions.

245,"The idea that consumers use brands to express their identities has led many companies to reposition their products from focusing on functional attributes to focusing on how they fit into a consumer's lifestyle. This repositioning is welcomed by managers who believe that by positioning their brands as means for self-expression, they are less likely to go head-to-head with their direct competitors. However, the authors argue that by doing so, these companies expose themselves to much broader, cross-category competition for a share of a consumer's identity. Thus, they propose that consumers’ need for self-expression through brands is finite and can be satiated when consumers are exposed to self-expressive brands. Moreover, they argue that consumers’ need for self-expression can be satiated not only by a brand's direct competitors but also by brands from unrelated product categories, nonbrand means of self-expression, and self-expressive behavioral acts. The authors examine these propositions in a series of five empirical studies that provide converging evidence in support of the notion that the need for self-expression can be satiated, thus weakening preferences for lifestyle brands.

246,"Although marketing researchers have emphasized the interactive nature of service encounters, there has been scant research regarding how dyadic behaviors in a service encounter are interrelated. The authors recognize two distinct forms of dyadic interdependency: process interdependency, in which each party's enactment of behavior influences the other's enactment of behavior, and outcome interdependency, in which the impact of each party's behavior on service outcome depends on the other party's behavior. Using the interpersonal circumplex model and its related concept of complementarity, the authors examine both forms of dyadic interdependency by directly observing provider–client interpersonal behaviors in a natural frontline service setting over an extended period. The findings on process interdependency indicate that dyadic behaviors elicit or inhibit each other largely in a complementary manner. The findings on outcome interdependency show that, in general, complementary interactions between the provider and client enhance the client's satisfaction, whereas anticomplementary interactions dampen the client's satisfaction.

247,"Understanding how relationships are damaged is a critical component in building and preserving strong distribution channels. Using longitudinal data from a Fortune 500 firm and its channel members, this research shows that perceived unfairness truly acts as “relationship poison” by directly damaging relationships, aggravating the negative effects of both conflict and opportunism, and undermining the benefits of using contracts to manage channel relationships. Surprisingly, at low levels of perceived unfairness, conflict and opportunism have small or even insignificant effects on channel member outcomes, which implies that research investigating the negative impact of conflict and opportunism on exchange outcomes may need reevaluation because these effects are contingent and may vary depending on the levels of perceived unfairness. In addition, the findings support the premise that using contracts to manage channel relationships represents a double-edged sword that suppresses the negative effects of conflict and opportunism while aggravating the negative effect of unfairness.

248,"Securitization is a remarkable financial instrument; it enables securitizers to increase their short-term profits at the expense of the long-term value of their customer base. This ability might be tempting for firms, especially because it does not need to be disclosed transparently to stakeholders. The authors show how their newly developed customer equity sustainability ratio (CESR) complements customer equity reporting and creates more transparency about the consequences of securitization for future earnings and the riskiness of the underlying business model. Their model compares the future value of an existing customer base with current earnings. In an empirical study of 38 banks in ten countries, the authors demonstrate the limited transparency of long-term value creation in financial statements. Next, they outline the adequacy of CESR for creating more transparency in empirical cases of Countrywide Financial Corporation and nine firms from nonbanking industries. They recommend that marketing should play a prominent role in providing stakeholders with substantial information about the long-term value of the customer base.

249,"When designing their products, companies try to employ shapes that are both emotionally appealing and compatible with the brand's image. One way to accomplish these aims is to anthropomorphize a product's appearance. The current research investigates how people decode emotional “facial” expressions from product shapes and how this affects liking of the design, using three studies in the domain of cars and one in the domain of cellular phones. In accordance with theories on the perception of human faces, the first study shows that perception of friendliness is limited to the grille (mouth), while aggressiveness can be communicated with both grille and headlights (eyes). The next study examines the best-liked combination of these two emotional expressions and finds that consumers prefer the combination of an upturned (friendly) grille with slanted (aggressive) headlights. The authors further explain this finding on a process level by showing that this combination triggers a positive affective state of both high pleasure and arousal. The third study validates the results with automobile sales data, and a fourth study extends the findings to another product category.

250,"Managers often extend brands to different quality levels (e.g., Charmin's lower-quality Charmin Basic), which may increase sales but risks diluting brand image. This study examines such line extensions by testing middle-quality brands (e.g., Giovanni's pasta sauce [fictitious], Foster's beer [real]) that offer higher-quality (e.g., Giovanni's Magnifico) or lower-quality line extensions (e.g., Foster's Grog). A robust asymmetry emerges in which higher-quality extensions improve brand evaluation far more than lower-quality extensions damage it. The asymmetry prevails across various perceptual and evaluative dimensions, multiple product classes, numerous fictitious and real brands that differ on various dimensions (familiarity, liking, personality, and prestige), and consumer regulatory focus. Group and individual-level tests show that the standard asymmetry is the modal pattern (though not universal) and that it is associated with two primary underlying processes: (1) opponent processes produced by lower-quality extensions whose negative quality-association effects are tempered by positive variety effects (in general, consumers prefer broader product lines) and (2) best-of-brand processing, in which consumers consider higher-quality extensions more relevant to brand evaluation than lower-quality extensions.

251,"The “saddle” is a sudden, sustained, and deep drop in sales of a new product, after a period of rapid growth following takeoff, followed by a gradual recovery to the former peak. The authors test for the generalizability of the saddle across products and countries and for three rival explanations: chasms in adopter segments, business cycles, and technological cycles. They model both boundary points of the saddle—start of the sales drop and recovery to the initial peak—using split-population models. Empirical analysis of historical sales data from ten products across 19 countries shows that the saddle is fairly pervasive. The onset of the saddle occurs in 148 product–country combinations. On average, the saddle occurs nine years after takeoff, at a mean penetration of 30%, and it lasts for eight years with a 29% drop in sales at its depth. The results support explanations of chasms and technological cycles for information/entertainment products and business cycles and technological cycles for kitchen/laundry products. The authors conclude with a discussion of the findings, contributions, and implications.

252,"Creating emotional brand attachment is a key branding issue in today's marketing world. One way to accomplish this is to match the brand's personality with the consumer's self. A key question, however, is whether the brand's personality should match the consumer's actual self or the consumer's ideal self. On the basis of two empirical studies of 167 brands (evaluated by 1329 and 980 consumers), the authors show that the implications of self-congruence for consumers’ emotional brand attachment are complex and differ by consumers’ product involvement, consumers’ individual difference variables, and the type of self-congruence (fit of the brand's personality with the consumer's actual self versus with the consumer's ideal self). On a general level, actual self-congruence has the greatest impact on emotional brand attachment. Product involvement, self-esteem, and public self-consciousness increase the positive impact of actual self-congruence but decrease the impact of ideal self-congruence on emotional brand attachment. The authors discuss important managerial and academic implications of these findings.

253,"In an effort to improve creativity in the new product development process, many firms offer incentive programs, creativity training programs, or both. However, creativity continues to be a construct that is not well understood in marketing, and little research has examined the joint influence of such initiatives on creative outcomes. As a result, there is considerable variance in the way firms approach these issues. A qualitative study of 20 firms indicates that 15 offered some type of incentive program, whereas only 7 engaged in creativity training (a subset of the firms used both). Given that previous research has consistently found that extrinsic rewards offered in isolation actually undermine the creative process (by reducing intrinsic motivation), it seems that many firms may be unwittingly hampering their own creative efforts. However, two experiments demonstrate that the effect of rewards can be made positive if offered in conjunction with appropriate training. Specifically, product creativity was highest when the monetary reward was paired with a dedicated creative training technique. The training alters the influence of the reward such that it reinforces, rather than undermines, intrinsic motivation. Managers can improve the effectiveness of their creative efforts by leveraging the use of incentives and training in combination.

254,"Because firms do not publicly report marketing expenditures, most studies of the link between firm value and marketing consider advertising (which is publicly reported for many firms) a proxy for marketing. The authors extend those studies in two ways. First, they broaden the proxy for marketing by considering both advertising and sales force. Second, they offer an explanation for the fact that some studies linking advertising to firm value find a positive relationship, whereas others find a negative relationship. The accounting literature suggests that the link to firm value for both unexpected growth in sales force expenditures and unexpected growth in advertising expenditures should be negative. The authors confirm the hypothesized accounting relationship for sales force expenditures but find a contingent relationship for advertising expenditures. Firm value and unexpected growth in advertising expenditures are negatively related for firms that advertise below the advertising response threshold, but they are positively related for firms that advertise above that threshold. Perhaps because this contingent relationship is difficult for analysts to learn through observation of the stock market, analysts ignore value-relevant advertising expenditure information when they forecast firm value.

255,"This research investigates the influence of incomplete typeface logos on consumer perceptions of the firm. In these logos, parts of the characters in the company name are intentionally missing or blanked out, giving rise to a form of perceptual ambiguity. Three studies demonstrate that although incomplete typeface logos have an unfavorable influence on perceived firm trustworthiness, they have a favorable influence on perceived firm innovativeness. The former influence is tied to the logo's perceived clarity, while the latter influence is tied to its perceived interestingness. Furthermore, incomplete typeface logos have an unfavorable influence on overall attitude toward the firm, but only for consumers with a prevention, rather than promotion, focus. These findings suggest that firms should avoid incomplete typeface logos if perceptions of trustworthiness are critical or if consumers are likely to have a prevention focus. However, such logos may be successfully employed with promotion-focused consumers, and they may be used as a tool to position a firm as innovative.

256,"In an effort to build long-term, profitable relationships, many companies systematically engage in multichannel relational communication—personalized messages sent to existing customers through various channels as part of a broader relationship marketing strategy. In this research, the authors examine three key drivers of relational communication effectiveness: volume of communication, mix of communication channels, and alignment of those channels with customers’ preferences. They hypothesize that customer response to relational communication follows a continuum in which reciprocity explains response to lower levels of communication, the classic ideal point describes a transition phase, and reactance explains response to higher levels of communication. They empirically test the theoretical framework by examining the impact of multichannel communication on repurchase over a three-year period. The results indicate that after the ideal level of communication is exceeded, customers react negatively. This negative response can be exacerbated by the use of multiple channels but attenuated by aligning channels with customer preferences. The findings suggest that the complex effects of multichannel communication can actually drive customers away from rather than closer to a company.

257,"Interfirm collaborative relationships for developing new products involve the two fundamental tasks of creating new knowledge and appropriating the newly created or current stocks of knowledge. This study examines the alignment of two contract terms—form of resource integration (how partners integrate their resources) and form of equity sharing (whether partners are engaged in equity investment)—for knowledge-creating and knowledge-appropriating relationship portfolios. By analyzing interfirm relationship agreements initiated in the pharmaceutical industry between 1990 and 2006, the author shows that knowledge-creating and knowledge-appropriating relationship portfolios benefit from different alignments of contract terms to address their unique concerns. The author also shows that the appropriate alignments of contract terms are more critical for small firms than for large firms. The results provide specific insights into the management of knowledge-creating and knowledge-appropriating relationship portfolios for developing a greater number of radical and incremental new products.
","We examine the role of organizational and strategic relationships in the development of a firm’s strategic relationships. We develop a model of organizational and strategic relationships that integrates the two dimensions of strategic relationships. We find that organizational and strategic relationships are associated with a firm’s ability to leverage its resources and resources to achieve strategic objectives. We also find that organizational and strategic relationships are associated with a firm’s ability to leverage its resources and resources to achieve strategic objectives.

259,"Marketers in the past have based their strategies on the assumption of infinite resources and zero environmental impact. With the growing recognition of finite resources and high environmental costs, marketers need to reexamine their theory and practices. They need to revise their policies on product development, pricing, distribution, and branding. The recent financial meltdown has added another layer of concern as consumers adjust their lifestyles to a lower level of income and spending. Companies must balance more carefully their growth goals with the need to pursue sustainability. Increased attention will be paid to employing demarketing and social marketing thinking to meet the new challenges.

260,"Conceptual advances are critical to the vitality of the marketing discipline, yet recent writings suggest that conceptual advancement in the field is slowing. The author addresses this issue by developing a framework for thinking about conceptualization in marketing. A definition of conceptualization is followed by a typology of types of conceptual contributions. The types of conceptual contributions, their similarities and differences, and their importance to the field are described. Thinking skills linked to various types of conceptual contributions are also described, as are the use of tools that can facilitate these skills. The article concludes with a set of recommendations for advancing conceptualization in our field in the years to come.
",The literature on the development of knowledge systems has been largely ignored. This paper aims to address this gap by examining the development of knowledge systems in the context of the digital transformation. We propose a new conceptualization of knowledge systems that is based on the concept of knowledge as a process of transformation. We propose that knowledge systems are defined as processes of transformation that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a set of processes that are characterized by a,-0.13522787,-0.19778411,-0.30468503,0.33844897,0.10262713,-0.6907956,-0.84121925,-0.045831926,0.07649693,0.707178,-0.35742623,-0.7694376,0.053101625,0.93835926,-0.48569232,-0.28054833,-0.7828674,-0.17087902,0.3724761,0.82772905,0.5811578,-0.026418585,-0.065789066,0.121826254,0.5034966,-0.080618,-0.38607842,0.7936705,0.19719896,-0.6232425,-1.1081378,0.90142584,1.3336455,-0.7295314,-1.2237271,-0.7880494,-0.22588682,1.0247159,-0.2471523,-0.2922743,0.27671003,1.1098539,-0.8404047,0.072760336,0.87464917,-0.4366184,-1.3579062,-1.150988,0.19357367,0.2728438,-0.8397229,-0.6662322,0.5308233,0.13633603,-0.43563625,0.09386689,-2.2137325,-1.6212373,0.8846973,0.5167165,0.41117105,0.333461,-0.5756509,-0.35315207,-1.8016884,0.31902355,-1.9647799,0.7928417,-0.5389115,-0.12791462,-0.042703103,1.2769513,-0.26292992,-0.98465055,-1.3678983,-0.20541681,1.4229655,0.26330885,0.49519858,0.43777245,2.496436,0.4637377,0.39197713,-0.12010892,-0.112670586,1.2944714,0.66778,-0.3393618,-0.97560215,-0.49403545,-1.0365701,0.39787713,0.44742525,0.005596069,-0.081574455,-0.87674063,0.28042033,-0.60037994,0.73727095,0.92874146,-0.21588208,-1.0729586,0.3034428,-0.50043714,0.483604,-0.11664397,-0.8874674,1.1136006,0.35804427,0.012349441,0.9304146,0.09910108,1.0816215,0.39071786,0.67625827,-0.79187036,0.31637684,-0.74543107,-0.41122448,0.1070659,1.1904569,0.17273499,-2.7077127,0.30305192,0.018183177,-0.37126914,0.0011128212,0.051506363
261,"Over the years, the level of analytical rigor has risen in articles published in marketing academic journals. While, ceteris paribus, rigor is desirable, there is a growing sense that rigor has become a, if not the, goal for research in marketing. Consequently, other desirable characteristics, such as relevance, communicability, and simplicity, have been downplayed, to the detriment of the field of marketing. The authors explore this imbalance, setting forth the consequences of overemphasis on rigor for (1) the manuscript review process, (2) PhD programs, (3) hiring, and (4) the tenure and promotion review process. Two surveys of “successful” authors provide empirical support for the conjectures put forth. The authors then identify the causes for this trend and propose some directions to reestablish a better balance between rigor and relevance.

We argue that IS are the most effective means of achieving the desired outcomes, and that they are the most effective means of achieving the desired outcomes, even when the IS are not fully operational.

262,"The core idea of this article is that five key characteristics—market heterogeneity, sociopolitical governance, chronic shortage of resources, unbranded competition, and inadequate infrastructure—of emerging markets are radically different from the traditional industrialized capitalist society, and they will require us to rethink the core assumptions of marketing, such as market orientation, market segmentation, and differential advantage. To accommodate these characteristics, we must rethink the marketing perspective (e.g., from differential advantage to market aggregation and standardization) and the core guiding strategy concepts (e.g., from market orientation to market development). Similarly, we must rethink issues of public policy (e.g., from compliance and crisis driven to purpose driven) and the marketing practice (e.g., from glocalization to fusion marketing).

263,"Marketers are being challenged by a deluge of data that is well beyond the capacity of their organizations to comprehend and use. Their strategies are not keeping up with the disruptive effects of technology-empowered customers; the proliferation of media, channel, and customer contact points; or the possibilities for microsegmentation. Closing the widening gap between the accelerating complexity of their markets and the limited ability of their organizations to respond demands new thinking about marketing capabilities. Three adaptive capabilities are needed: (1) Vigilant market learning that enhances deep market insights with an advance warning system to anticipate market changes and unmet needs, (2) adaptive market experimentation that continuously learns from experiments, and (3) open marketing that forges relationships with those at the forefront of new media and social networking technologies and mobilizes the skills of current partners. The benefits of these adaptive capabilities will only be realized in organizations that are more resilient and free-flowing, with vigilant leadership and more adaptive business models.

264,"The marketing decision models field has produced many striking developments that have had a dramatic impact on practice. However, the field has produced orders of magnitude more developments that have received minimal use. In this article, the author notes the many successful marketing model developments but then considers the relatively low level of practical use (trial or adoption) and questions why that is the case. He then suggests how changes in the incentive and reward systems for marketing academics, marketing practitioners, and marketing intermediaries can bring about adoption and implementation improvements that would be mutually beneficial, bridging the academic–practitioner divide. The author also outlines a program of research in the area of the adoption and use of marketing decision models that will provide guidance on what to develop and how to get those developments adopted.

265,"The concept of managerial relevance continues to be a significant topic for both research faculty and business schools alike. Despite decades of debate, it is surprising that there is virtually no work on the nature of the concept itself. Thus, the author defines the concept of managerial relevance, makes three specific observations, and discusses research implications for each observation. The key message is that the field needs a much deeper understanding of the marketing roles within the firm, and research programs must be crafted to fit the needs of these particular roles. The author calls this approach “role-relevant” managerial research. With this central thesis in mind, he examines the role of the chief marketing officer (CMO) as an illustrative case study to identify areas of inquiry that are both novel and highly managerially relevant. This analysis reveals that of the seven core tasks of the CMO, three have been lightly investigated. The author concludes with advice to both academics and practitioners on how to increase the role relevance of academic research.
","The research on organizational learning is a critical area of research in the field of organizational learning.

266,"The system for the design, production, and dissemination of marketing scholarship aimed at contributing to marketing practice is under increasing strain due to pressures exerted by globalization, digitization, and environmentalism. Scholarly research in marketing adheres largely to a twentieth-century manufacturing model. Change is needed now. Marketing scholarship can benefit from embracing a twenty-first-century, collaborative approach to the conception, design, and dissemination of research. “Crowdsourcing” is becoming a frequently employed strategy in industry. Marketing academe should adopt some of the same techniques and technologies to make stronger research contributions that will benefit marketing practice. In particular, more collaboration is needed, both among academic researchers and between academe and industry, to be sure important problems are being investigated using sound theories and methods. An open, collaborative model will allow the field to evolve from Marketing Scholarship 1.0 to Marketing Scholarship 2.0.

267,"Network effects and standards competition introduce significant market uncertainty, creating a substantial challenge to the success of innovating firms. Although the literature has highlighted the importance of establishing a large installed-user base (the number of users adopting the same product) in such markets, the authors draw attention to a different, but potentially important, market force: the supporting-firm base, which they define as the number of firms supporting the same technological standard. They test their proposed hypotheses using data from two markets: the floppy disk drive and personal digital assistant markets. Their results show that (1) consumer product valuation is positively affected not only by the installed-user base but also by the supporting-firm base, (2) the two positive effects interact with each other and the nature of the interaction changes over the evolution of the market (i.e., they strengthen each other's impact in the early stage but weaken each other's impact in the late stage of the product life cycle), and (3) not all supporting firms are equally valuable to the innovator—specifically, consumers are affected more by firms exclusively supporting a single standard than by firms supporting multiple standards and by incumbents than by new entrants.

268,"Category management (CM) is challenging for retailers that sell thousands of products across hundreds of categories and often lack the resources and capabilities to manage all of them intensively. Some retailers respond by picking one supplier to be a “category captain” that manages the category—including rivals’ brands—on their behalf. Others worry that influential captains will be opportunistic and that the benefits of intensive CM are simply not worth the costs. However, there is little conceptual development or empirical evidence concerning CM best practices. The authors develop a comprehensive model of retail CM based on a synthesis of field interviews and relevant literature, especially work on governance value analysis theory. Their test of the model using category and financial growth data from U.S. supermarket chains shows that more intensive CM improves results. Furthermore, use of a category captain increases CM effort and results, without increasing opportunism or problems with other suppliers. The authors also find that retailers with more resources are less likely to rely on help from a category captain; yet the level of retailer resources is not related to CM intensity. Thus, “go-it-alone” retailers do not deploy their own resources on CM and miss out on the corresponding performance improvements.

269,"Although the number and importance of joint innovation projects between suppliers and their customers continue to rise, the literature has yet to resolve a key question: Do embedded ties with customers help or hurt supplier innovation? Drawing on both the tie strength and knowledge literatures, the authors theorize that embedded ties interact with supplier and customer innovation knowledge to influence supplier innovation. In a sample of 157 Dutch business-to-business innovation relationships, they observe that embedded ties weaken how much suppliers benefit from customer innovation knowledge because of worries about customer opportunism (the dark side of embedded ties). However, they uncover three moderating relationship and governance features that allow suppliers to overcome these dark-side effects and even increase innovation (the bright side of embedded ties). Finally, although the authors predicted a bright-side effect, they find that embedded ties neither help nor hinder the supplier to leverage its own innovation knowledge in the relationship.

270,"Corporate acquisitions are a ubiquitous feature of today's business landscape and a widely used means by which large firms enter new markets. As large acquirers swoop in to acquire firms in new markets, they are almost inevitably met with a chorus of concerns about the potential effects of their actions on the markets they enter. What is the actual impact of acquisitive entry by large firms on the strategies and performance of incumbents? How do incumbents reconfigure the way they compete after a behemoth enters their market? The authors focus on an important facet of firms’ competitive positions—their product mix—and propose a framework that explains incumbent firms’ reaction to acquisitive entry by large firms, as well as the performance implications of these reactions. They test the hypotheses that result from this framework by examining the impact of acquisitive entry across a large number of firms and consumer markets over time: The data cover 839 acquisitions in 583 metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S. banking industry. The results indicate that incumbents are more likely to align their product mix strategy with that of the acquisitive entrant if (1) the incumbent is large, (2) the acquirer's past performance has been strong, and (3) the market served by the incumbent is small. Importantly, how incumbents react has significant performance implications: The authors find that large incumbents that deviate from acquirers’ product mix strategy perform better than other incumbents do.
","We examine the impact of firm-level competition on the firm’s competitive position in the market for new products. We find that firms with higher levels of competition in the market for new products are more likely to enter the market for new products, and that firms with lower levels of competition in the market for new products are more likely to enter the market for new products. We also find that firms with higher levels of competition in the market for new products are more likely to enter the market for new products, and that firms with lower levels of competition in the market for new products are more likely to enter the market for new products. We also find that firms with higher levels of competition in the market for new products are more likely to enter the market for new products, and that firms with lower levels of competition in the market for new products are more likely to enter the market for new products. We also find that firms with higher levels of competition in the market for new products are more likely to enter the market for new products, and that firms with lower levels of competition in the market for new products are more likely to enter the market for new products.

271,"Using survey and transaction data from a natural experiment in a fast-food chain, the authors investigate the effects of store remodeling. They test (1) short- and long-term effects on customers’ cognitions, affect, and behavioral intentions; (2) the moderating impact of spontaneous versus planned and group versus single-customer store visits; and (3) the differential effects on two store performance measures: average customer spending and store traffic. The results show that, in line with adaptation-level theory, short-term remodeling effects lose strength in the long run (i.e., after six months). Furthermore, customers on a spontaneous trip or in a group tend to be more responsive to store remodeling than customers on a planned trip or alone. Finally, whereas average spending increases in the short run and then returns to the baseline, store traffic initially remains unaffected and even shows a dip in the long run. These findings imply that ignoring the time-variant character of remodeling effects, the nature of customers’ store visits, or the impact on store traffic may lead to inappropriate allocation of marketing resources.

272,"This study examines the impact of brand quality on three components of shareholder wealth: stock returns, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. The study finds that brand quality enhances shareholder wealth insofar as unanticipated changes in brand quality are positively associated with stock returns and negatively related to changes in idiosyncratic risk. However, unanticipated changes in brand quality can also erode shareholder wealth because they have a positive association with changes in systematic risk. The study introduces a contingency theory view to the marketing–finance interface by analyzing the moderating role of two factors that are widely followed by investors. The results show an unanticipated increase (decrease) in current-period earnings enhances (depletes) the positive impact of unanticipated changes in brand quality on stock returns and mitigates (enhances) their deleterious effects on changes in systematic risk. Similarly, brand quality is more valuable for firms facing increasing competition (i.e., unanticipated decreases in industry concentration). The results are robust to endogeneity concerns and across alternative models. The authors conclude by discussing the nuanced implications of their findings for shareholder wealth, reporting brand quality to investors, and its use in employee evaluation.

273,"The plot structure in television advertisements can enhance consumers’ brand attitudes and foster increasing consumer and industry recognition. A corpus analysis of contemporary television advertisements shows that advertisements using the repetition-break plot structure are a small percentage of television advertisements but a large percentage of Clio and Effie award–winning advertisements. They are also likely to attain postings and views on YouTube. Three experiments using television advertisements from contemporary brands show that repetition-break advertisements are persuasive, leading to more favorable brand attitudes and greater purchase intentions than similar plot structures and that this effect is attributable in part to the advertisements being more engaging. Thus, a theoretically explainable and generic plot structure yields effective advertisements. The result is a new and flexible tool for marketing professionals to use to generate advertisements, with guidelines for when and why it should and should not be effective.
","We propose a novel model of consumer behavior that incorporates the social context of a product’s social media presence. We show that consumers’ social media presence can influence the likelihood of a product being sold to a retailer. We find that consumers’ social media presence influences the likelihood of a product being sold to a retailer by increasing the likelihood of a retailer’s sales to consumers. We also find that consumers’ social media presence can influence the likelihood of a retailer’s sales to consumers by increasing the likelihood of a retailer’s sales to consumers.

274,"While interest in customization is growing among consumers and academics, researchers have focused on consumers designing products for themselves. Many customization firms, however, are successfully positioning themselves as key sources for unique gifts. In this research, the authors examine whether factors under the firm's control (i.e., the level of design support provided and the presence of a strong brand) are differentially effective when consumers design products for themselves or as gifts for others. Using participants drawn from the relevant target market, they report two studies involving real customization tasks undertaken on fully functioning customization websites. The findings lead to the surprising conclusion that design support is less effective for consumers designing products intended as gifts rather than for themselves, raising expectations without a corresponding rise in evaluations. However, the results offer some good news to firms targeting gift-giving consumers. Both Studies 1 and 2 reveal that gift-givers place a higher value on their own time and effort and thus report a higher willingness to pay than those designing for themselves. This effect is diminished, however, when a strong brand is present and consumers share credit with the brand for the product's design.

275,"This article examines key success factors for designing and delivering combinations of goods and services (i.e., hybrid offerings) in business markets. Goods manufacturers, unlike pure service providers, find themselves in a unique position to grow revenues through hybrid offerings but must learn how to leverage unique resources and build distinctive capabilities. Using case studies and depth interviews with senior executives in manufacturing companies, the authors develop a resource–capability framework as a basis for research and practice. Executives identify four critical resources: (1) product usage and process data derived from the firm's installed base of physical goods, (2) product development and manufacturing assets, (3) an experienced product sales force and distribution network, and (4) a field service organization. In leveraging these specific resources, successful firms build five critical capabilities: (1) service-related data processing and interpretation capability, (2) execution risk assessment and mitigation capability, (3) design-to-service capability, (4) hybrid offering sales capability, and (5) hybrid offering deployment capability. These capabilities influence manufacturers’ positional advantage in two directions: differentiation and cost leadership. The authors propose a new typology of industrial services and discuss how resources and capabilities affect success across categories of hybrid offers.

276,"This study explores the role of customers’ social network in their defection from a service provider. The authors use data on communication among one million customers of a cellular company to create a large-scale social system composed of customers’ individual social networks. The study's results indicate that exposure to a defecting neighbor is associated with an increase of 80% in the defection hazard, after controlling for a host of social, personal, and purchase-related variables. This effect is comparable in both magnitude and nature to social effects observed in the highly researched case of product adoption: The extent of social influence on retention decays exponentially over time, and the likelihood of defection is affected by tie strength and homophily with defecting neighbors and by these neighbors’ average number of connections. Highly connected customers are more affected, and loyal customers are less affected by defections that occur in their social networks. These results carry important implications for the theoretical understanding of the drivers of customer retention and should be considered by firms that aim to predict and affect customer retention.
","We study the impact of social network effects on the likelihood of a customer’s purchase of a product. We examine the relationship between social network effects and the likelihood of a customer’s purchase of a product. We find that social network effects are positively related to the likelihood of a customer’s purchase of a product. Social network effects are associated with the likelihood of a customer’s purchase of a product, whereas social network effects are associated with the likelihood of a customer’s purchase of a product.

277,"Two-sided markets are composed of platform owners and two distinct user networks that either buy or sell applications for the platform. The authors focus on multihoming—the choice of an agent in a user network to use more than one platform. In the context of the video game console industry, they examine the conditions affecting seller-level multihoming decisions on a given platform. Furthermore, they investigate how platform-level multihoming of applications affects the sales of the platform. The authors show that increased platform-level multihoming of applications hurts platform sales, a finding consistent with literature on brand differentiation, but they also show that this effect vanishes as platforms mature or gain market share. The authors find that platform-level multihoming of applications affects platform sales more strongly than the number of applications. Furthermore, among mature platforms, an increasing market share leads to more seller-level multihoming, while among nascent platforms, seller-level multihoming decreases as platform market share increases. These findings prompt scholars to look beyond network size in analyzing two-sided markets and provide guidance to both (application) sellers and platform owners.

278,"Seeding strategies have strong influences on the success of viral marketing campaigns, but previous studies using computer simulations and analytical models have produced conflicting recommendations about the optimal seeding strategy. This study compares four seeding strategies in two complementary small-scale field experiments, as well as in one real-life viral marketing campaign involving more than 200,000 customers of a mobile phone service provider. The empirical results show that the best seeding strategies can be up to eight times more successful than other seeding strategies. Seeding to well-connected people is the most successful approach because these attractive seeding points are more likely to participate in viral marketing campaigns. This finding contradicts a common assumption in other studies. Well-connected people also actively use their greater reach but do not have more influence on their peers than do less well-connected people.

279,"The growing number of sales channels through which customers can make purchases has made it imperative for managers to understand how customers decide which channels to use. However, this presents a significant challenge because there is reason to believe the channel decision process evolves over the lifetime of the customer. The authors document the existence and nature of this phenomenon by analyzing the evolution of a customer's channel choice decision process from a trial stage to a posttrial stage. First, they analyze data for a book retailer and replicate their analysis using data from a durables and apparel retailer. Their results suggest that (1) customers’ decision processes do evolve, (2) a minority but sizeable segment changes decision processes within the observation period, and (3) customers who change do so from a decision process in which they are highly responsive to marketing to one in which they are less responsive. The authors illustrate and discuss the implications for both managers and researchers.

280,"The strategic importance of business-to-business (B2B) relationships is well recognized, but their financial impact remains equivocal. This study links social capital from three types of B2B networks of young technology firms with their initial public offering (IPO) value. The authors identify three relevant types of absorptive capacity that facilitate the transformation of B2B social capital into IPO value. For the transformation to occur, the authors find that young firms need not only the opportunity to access the resources provided by B2B relationships but also the ability to leverage them through the complementary capability—namely, absorptive capacity. They test the hypotheses on a sample of 177 IPOs, and the results are robust to endogeneity concerns and alternative measures. As one of the first studies in marketing–finance interface to focus on young firms, the findings provide novel insights, such as the deleterious financial consequence of having marketing and research-and-development B2B relationships without the relevant absorptive capacity. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial implications regarding communicating the value of absorptive capacity, disclosure of marketing-related information, and the importance of marketing for young technology firms.

281,"Success of many products depends on how consumers learn to use them. This research suggests that initial product trial may lead to jumps in consumer learning. Such discontinuities in learning co-occur with the experience of insight—namely, a better conceptual understanding of how to use the product. Notably, such learning also positively affects downstream outcomes such as affect and usage intentions. Whereas exploration during initial trial facilitates insight-based learning, usage instructions seem to limit this type of learning. The implication for marketing managers is to structure initial trials in a manner conducive to exploration, thus leading to insight-driven learning and the associated positive outcomes.

282,"Consumer regret can result in unfavorable outcomes for marketers. To prevent regret, many retailers promise to refund money to consumers who discover lower prices after purchase. The authors show that a refund's effect on felt regret depends on how consumers view these promises. If consumers mainly view them as protective tools (i.e., adopt a protection focus), postrefund regret is minimal. If consumers primarily view such promises as sources of information about the retailer's price status (i.e., adopt an information focus), regret persists even after refund. The authors show that regret persists with these consumers because finding a lower price results in a perception of trust violation. They find that subject to boundary conditions, using a disclaimer that states that the retailer does not claim to offer the lowest prices helps avoid this negative outcome for information-focused consumers. The authors contribute to the literature on outcome reversibility and regret by showing that outcome reversal does not necessarily obviate regret. In addition, they show that regulatory focus serves as the motivational basis for how consumers view refund promises.

283,"The authors investigate whether, and to what extent, marketing conduct varies over the business cycle and how this contributes to the growing popularity of private labels. To address this issue, they examine a unique data set that combines a broad set of seven marketing-mix instruments with private-label share, using two decades' worth of data for 106 consumer packaged goods categories in the United States. The results show that private-label share behaves countercyclically and that part of the boost in private-label share during contractions is permanent. Retailers' observed practice of supporting their own labels in contraction periods while cutting back in expansion periods helps this cyclical sensitivity even further. In addition, national brands' procyclical behavior in terms of (1) major new product introductions, (2) advertising, and (3) their promotional pressure compared with private labels is associated with more pronounced cyclical fluctuations in private-label share and even with permanent private-label market share gains. Although brand managers cannot be held responsible for the occurrence of economic downswings, they can be held accountable for how much contractions help strengthen their fiercest competitor, the store brands owned by their very customers.

284,"Cross- and up-selling in inbound call centers is a growing business practice, with the promise of enhanced revenue generation and customer retention. Yet firms struggle to create conditions that are conducive to customer service representatives' (CSRs') concurrent engagement in service and sales. By developing a framework of the antecedents and performance consequences of aligned sales and customer service provision, this study advances understanding of ambidexterity at the employee level. The framework receives strong support from an empirical study based on CSRs' survey responses and matched performance data. A CSR's locomotion orientation facilitates ambidextrous behavior and interacts positively with an assessment orientation. However, team identification and bounded discretion impair this valuable interplay. Ambidextrous behavior also increases customer satisfaction and sales performance but decreases efficiency. Nevertheless, the overall performance effect is positive.

285,"Brand acquisitions and disposals are key strategic marketing decisions and often the largest single marketing investments that firms make. Yet little is known about the performance effects of such decisions. This study examines stock market reactions to brand acquisition and disposal announcements in 31 consumer industries. The results reveal that returns to such announcements depend crucially on three complementary firm assets—marketing capabilities, channel relationships, and brand portfolios—but that these effects may not be symmetric across brand acquisitions and disposals. Acquirer abnormal returns are greater for firms with strong marketing capabilities and those that buy brands with higher price/quality positioning than their existing portfolio. Investors also reward buyers that identify cost synergies in integrating new brand(s) into their portfolios but punish those that identify revenue synergies. Conversely, greater abnormal returns arise for sellers with inferior channel relationships and for those selling multiple brands, brands with relatively lower price/quality positioning than the seller's remaining portfolio, and brands unrelated to the rest of the seller's portfolio. The results from a paired subsample provide new knowledge about the positive net shareholder wealth created from brand acquisition–disposal transactions and indicate a strong role of marketing capabilities in creating this wealth.

286,"Nutritional labels are mandatory on virtually all packaged food items sold in the United States. The nutritional information on these labels is reported on a “per-serving-size” basis. However, unbeknownst to many consumers, current Food and Drug Administration regulations allow manufacturers some discretion in setting serving sizes—a factor that the authors hypothesize has implications for consumer behavior. For example, adopting a smaller serving size allows marketers to reduce the reported calories, fat, sugar, and carbohydrates in a product serving, which in turn can influence the anticipated consequences of consumption. Three studies show that manipulating the serving size, and thus calories per serving, for equivalent consumption amounts influences the anticipated guilt of consumption, purchase intentions, and choice behavior. However, the results also show that individual difference and context variables, which heighten consumer attention to nutritional information in general, often focus attention on calorie information but not serving size. This leads to the counterintuitive finding that more nutritionally vigilant consumers are more heavily influenced by serving size manipulations. The authors discuss the managerial and public policy implications.

287,"The authors assess how and why retailer-customized coupon campaigns affect customer purchases. The conceptual model proposes effects on trip incidence and revenues through the mere exposure to campaigns (exposure effect) and the redemption of coupons (redemption effect). The authors propose monetary savings of the coupons, regularity of the campaigns, and coupon fit with customer preferences as moderators. Analysis of data from a group of regional grocery chains that were part of a quasi experiment demonstrates that retailer-customized coupon campaigns have a positive exposure and redemption effect on customer purchases. Mere exposure to customized coupon campaigns contributes more than coupon redemption to campaign returns. Consistent with theoretical expectations, customized coupon campaigns are more effective if they provide more discounts, are unexpected, and are positioned as specially selected for and customized to consumer preferences. The substantial exposure effects suggest that managers should look beyond redemption rates and also consider sales lift from nonredeemers when measuring the effectiveness of customized coupon campaigns.

288,"Environmental communications often contain assertive commands, even though research in consumer behavior, psycholinguistics, and communications has repeatedly shown that gentler phrasing is more effective when seeking consumer compliance. This article shows that the persuasiveness of assertive language depends on the perceived importance of the issue at hand: Recipients respond better to pushy requests in domains that they view as important, but they need more suggestive appeals when they lack initial conviction. The authors examine this effect in three laboratory studies and one field experiment using Google AdWords. Their findings refer to various environmental contexts (i.e., economizing water, recycling plastic containers, reducing air and sea pollution). The key implication of these findings is that issue importance needs to be carefully assessed (or affected) before the language of effective environmental campaigns can be selected.

289,"Although consumers report positive attitudes toward ethical goods, their intentions and behaviors often do not follow suit. Just-world theory highlights the conditions under which consumers are most likely to prefer fair-trade products. This theory proposes that people are motivated to construe the world as a just place where people get what they deserve. In the current research, when people are confronted with high levels of injustice (communicated need is high) and avenues for justice restoration seem uncertain or unavailable, assisting others by supporting fair trade decreases. However, highlighting how injustice can be redressed through purchases enhances fair-trade support under conditions of high need. The effects are moderated by justice sensitivity factors, such as just-world beliefs and whether the product type (indulgence vs. necessity) makes the injustice of consumer privilege salient. The results suggest that communicating high need when requesting consumer prosocial actions can sometimes backfire. Marketers employing high need appeals should heighten perceptions of justice restoration potential and activate fairness-related thoughts through product positioning to encourage fair-trade purchases.

290,"This research delineates and empirically tests how regulatory depletion may affect high-stress employees' service performance on different types of job tasks. Using a laboratory experiment and a survey study, the authors examine (1) whether work stress causes a depletion effect, such that high work stress undermines service employees' performance on tasks requiring self-regulation (e.g., customer complaint handling performance) versus tasks requiring limited self-regulation (e.g., customer-directed extra-role performance); (2) whether the depletion effect can be overcome by supervisory support or employees' engagement in perspective taking; and (3) how these moderating effects might be mediated by employees' feelings of fatigue and intrinsic job motivation. The results confirm regulatory depletion: High-stress employees feel more fatigue and perform more poorly than low-stress employees in tasks requiring self-regulation. However, the depletion effect from work stress is largely attenuated on employees' performance on tasks requiring less or limited self-regulation. The mediated moderation tests further show that the extent of the depletion effect is not uniform. Employees who can replenish their resources from supervisory support or enhance their goal focus by engaging in perspective taking are less affected by regulatory depletion. These buffering effects occur because of enhanced intrinsic job motivation.

291,"Using a grounded theory approach, the authors investigate the nature and consequences of brand love. Arguing that research on brand love needs to be built on an understanding of how consumers actually experience this phenomenon, they conduct two qualitative studies to uncover the different elements (“features”) of the consumer prototype of brand love. Then, they use structural equations modeling on survey data to explore how these elements can be modeled as both first-order and higher-order structural models. A higher-order model yields seven core elements: self–brand integration, passion-driven behaviors, positive emotional connection, long-term relationship, positive overall attitude valence, attitude certainty and confidence (strength), and anticipated separation distress. In addition to these seven core elements of brand love itself, the prototype includes quality beliefs as an antecedent of brand love and brand loyalty, word of mouth, and resistance to negative information as outcomes. Both the first-order and higher-order brand love models predict loyalty, word of mouth, and resistance better, and provide a greater understanding, than an overall summary measure of brand love. The authors conclude by presenting theoretical and managerial implications.

292,"Customers are the most important assets of most companies, such that customer equity has been used as a proxy for shareholder value. However, linking customer metrics to shareholder value without considering debt and non-operating assets ignores their effects on relative changes in customer equity and leads to biased estimates. In developing a new theoretical framework for customer-based valuation, grounded in valuation theory, this article links the value of all customers to shareholder value and introduces a new leverage effect that can translate percentage changes in customer equity into shareholder value. The average leverage effect in more than 2000 companies across ten years is 1.55, which indicates that a 10% increase in customer equity is amplified to a 15.5% increase in shareholder value. This research also compares the influence of customer and financial metrics on shareholder value. The findings challenge previous notions about the dominant effect of the retention rate and underline the importance of predicting the number of future acquired customers for a company.

293,"Consumers engage in self-production when they play an active role in the creation of end products, such as preparing a meal or assembling a piece of furniture. In three experimental studies of self-production involving a branded input product, the authors show that consumers’ active engagement in the value creation process (preparing a meal) positively biases their evaluations of an outcome (a dish) and an input product (a dinner kit). A positive evaluation bias for the input product occurs despite increased self-attribution due to self-production. In support of an associative self-anchoring explanation and the notion of self-generated validity, self-producing consumers bias their sensory perceptions (e.g., perceived level of saltiness and spiciness) so that they match a positive evaluation of the outcome. Mediation analyses show that perceived self-integration (perceived link between self and outcome) partly mediates the positive effect of self-production on outcome evaluation. The authors conclude that branded input products may benefit from the evaluation bias caused by self-production.

294,"To increase service productivity, many companies utilize automation extensively to reduce the use of labor. However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor–automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality.

295,"Prior research has found that under certain conditions, small packages can paradoxically increase consumption. The authors build on this work by suggesting that people low in appearance self-esteem (ASE) are particularly sensitive to external control properties (i.e., packaging-related factors that signal the ability of packaging to regulate food intake) and, as a result, increase consumption levels when packages are small (vs. large or absent). Factors that highlight the external control properties of small packages, such as the visibility of product quantity, location of the caloric content, and communicated caloric content, further increase consumption, particularly among people with low ASE. The underlying process appears to be, at least in part, cognitively driven. The effects are mitigated when participants are under cognitive load, and the findings are mediated by cognitions regarding the ability of small packages to regulate food intake. The results have important practical implications suggesting that to quell the effects of small packages on overconsumption, emphasis on the external control properties of small packages should be minimized.

296,"This research is the first to examine service sweethearting, an illicit behavior that costs firms billions of dollars annually in lost revenues. Sweethearting occurs when frontline workers give unauthorized free or discounted goods and services to customer conspirators. The authors gather dyadic data from 171 service employees and 610 of their customers. The results from the employee data reveal that a variety of job, social, and remuneration factors motivate sweethearting behavior and several measurable employee traits suppress its frequency. The results from the customer data indicate that although sweethearting inflates a firm's satisfaction, loyalty, and positive word-of-mouth scores by as much as 9%, satisfaction with the confederate employee fully mediates these effects. Thus, any benefits for customer satisfaction or loyalty initiatives are tied to a frontline worker that the firm would rather not employ. Marketing managers can use this study to recognize job applicants or company settings that are particularly prone to sweethearting and as the basis for mitigating a positive bias in key customer metrics.

297,"This research addresses three questions: (1) To what extent do new-to-the-firm products (with market and technology newness) face resistance in winning approval for development during the review process? (2) To what degree does product development teams’ use of micropolitical strategies help reduce resistance and get approval with minimum compromise in the product? (3) To what extent do some of these micropolitical strategies harm the new product's performance? The findings suggest that products with both market and technology newness encounter resistance in getting approval for development. If the product development team wants to reduce resistance to products with market newness, it needs to build a coalition of supporters that can help it during the review process. Similarly, if the team seeks to minimize resistance to products with technology newness, it should frame the product in terms of the firms’ existing products, strategies, and competitive thrusts. However, such framing increases resistance to market newness. If products continue to be resisted, they must be compromised (i.e., modified as a concession) to win approval. If the team wants to reduce the degree of compromise, it should initially develop the product in hiding. Products that are compromised perform poorly in the marketplace.

298,"Third-party product reviews (TPRs) have become ubiquitous in many industries. Aided by communication technologies, particularly on the Internet, TPRs are widely available to consumers, managers, and investors. The authors examine whether and how TPRs of new products influence the financial value of firms introducing the products. An event study covering 14 major media and professional reviews of movies released by 21 studios shows that TPRs exert significant impact on stock returns in the direction of their valence. However, the impact comes from the valence of a review that is measured relative to other, previously published reviews and not from the absolute valence of the review itself. The authors further study the dynamics of TPR impact on firm value and find that the impact exists only for prerelease reviews and is the strongest on the product release date, though it disappears when sales information becomes available after product release. These results demonstrate that TPRs play significant roles as the investors update their expectation about new product sales potential. The authors also find that advertising spending increases the positive impact of TPRs on firm value and buffer the negative impact. Therefore, firms could strategically use marketing instruments such as advertising to moderate the impact of TPRs.

299,"Using a large-scale, multilevel data set, this study introduces to the sales management literature the concept of sales representatives' headquarters stereotypes as a negative outcome of social identification. The results suggest that work team identification fosters headquarters stereotyping more strongly when organizational identification is low than when it is high. Salespeople's physical distance from their corporate headquarters increases work team identification and decreases organizational identification. Competitive intensity, as an external threat to salespeople's social identity, strengthens stereotyping and social identification. In addition to important theoretical implications, this research also provides crucial insights for managers. Headquarters stereotypes are critically important because they can have harmful consequences for sales performance and customer satisfaction. Key managerial implications are that managers should foster organizational identification and that using different compensation systems does not remedy the negative effects of stereotypes.

300,"Previous research has conceptualized and modeled customer orientation (CO) in one of two ways: as a psychological phenomenon antecedent to critical job states (i.e., stress and engagement) or as frontline employee behaviors that are caused by these same job states. Building on meta-analytic data, this study finds greater support for the causal relationships implied by a psychological construal of the construct and reveals that CO influences frontline employees' job outcomes through its effects on stress and engagement. Moderation analyses also indicate that CO's influence on model variables is stronger when frontline employees' customer workloads increase and is weaker as the need for customer persuasion increases. These findings contradict widely held assumptions rooted in a behavioral view of CO—namely, that CO is a consequence of job states, a proximate determinant of job outcomes, and most beneficial when ample opportunity for customer engagement exists. Overall, the results support a broadened perspective that recognizes that CO improves job outcomes because it enhances frontline employees' psychological welfare in addition to being good for business. These findings suggest that managers should consider CO an important criterion in frontline employee decisions, recognize CO as beneficial when limited opportunity for customer engagement exists, and avoid efforts to curtail CO's costs at the frontline employee level.

301,"Firms doing business in foreign institutional environments face pressures to gain social acceptance (commonly referred to as legitimacy) and difficulty in evaluating market information, both of which undercut firm performance. In this article, the authors argue that firms can design governance strategies to deal with foreign institutions to secure both social acceptance and firm performance. Using a Chinese sample of manufacturers that export products to various foreign markets through local distributors, the authors develop and test a model that bridges the effects of institutional environments and governance strategy on channel performance. Specifically, they find that firms can use two governance strategies, contract customization and relational governance, to deal with both legitimacy and efficiency issues and to safeguard channel performance. Thus, international channel managers are advised to maintain an integrated management of legitimacy and efficiency in foreign marketing channels.
","We examine the role of organizational and market incentives in the development of a firm’s strategic strategy. We find that firms with high organizational incentives are more likely to adopt strategic strategies that are more aligned with the firm's strategic objectives. We also find that firms with low market incentives are more likely to adopt strategic strategies that are more aligned with the firm's strategic objectives. We also find that firms with high market incentives are more likely to adopt strategic strategies that are more aligned with the firm's strategic objectives. We discuss the implications of these findings for firms and managers of strategic alliances and for the development of strategic alliances.This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.  10/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/27/18  \  11/",1.4735496,-1.750547,-1.519105,-0.5139703,0.06293729,0.16046563,-0.5342301,-0.047598697,0.9560501,0.9269072,1.2782794,0.11109349,0.091471456,-1.3515946,0.81191677,-0.17505898,-0.48497885,1.6343396,-0.07566921,0.8528036,1.2379172,0.49360955,-0.5617976,0.52356017,-1.5175066,1.0833313,1.0387664,0.34619436,-0.14313337,-0.22913525,0.08652526,0.21903156,0.29503584,-1.0447803,-0.9480477,1.1827859,-0.6610517,0.71507293,-0.4499817,1.3787689,-0.107901275,1.3701868,0.2326027,0.95625126,-0.3654384,-1.2189012,0.5412897,-1.0276101,0.907759,-0.15934315,0.5735886,0.91513246,0.7430449,0.81951815,-1.2576892,-0.26899356,0.43094805,0.23075351,0.33853123,0.42931995,0.7160693,2.1189067,-0.40608013,0.60830325,1.1135172,0.105728194,0.28541675,-0.7312803,-0.6963714,-0.4598866,0.60089767,1.4108546,-0.15448163,-2.1668205,-0.84393525,0.2592391,0.034577895,0.028374385,0.46797237,-0.11106503,1.3852842,-0.4678887,-1.097041,0.2869285,-0.19676057,0.76624846,0.9128478,0.1845984,-1.8424358,0.05945144,1.2216576,0.23402353,0.27125937,0.05145916,-0.039690573,-1.4953736,-1.1815732,0.9878005,0.49893785,-0.1335902,1.2578522,-0.9904701,1.1916815,0.10414385,-0.7993086,0.38885626,-2.0631297,0.8800021,-0.72648025,-0.019124983,1.0392942,0.33700576,0.4941137,1.4654218,0.6426533,0.43692824,0.102756135,0.11446752,-0.005275855,2.0539694,-0.49956343,0.009952295,-0.8099144,0.012665616,-0.4831819,-0.66525483,0.0539839,0.26593196
302,"Comprehensive performance measurement systems such as the balanced scorecard have received considerable attention in marketing. However, whether and under which circumstances comprehensiveness as a performance measurement system property is desirable and contributes to firm performance is still a subject of debate in research and practice. To address this issue, the authors use dyadic field data from marketing managers and management accounting executives and extend prior work by developing and testing a more complex, contingency-based model. The empirical results confirm the developed framework. In particular, the results show that the relationship of comprehensiveness in a marketing performance measurement system to firm performance is conditional. Marketing alignment and market-based knowledge mediate this relationship, depending on marketing strategy, marketing complexity, and market dynamism. These insights explain mixed findings of previous research and provide important implications for research and managerial practice.

303,"Conventional wisdom, marketing literature, and cross-selling practices to date are based on the notion that customer cross-buying is positively associated with customer profitability. However, this study finds that when certain customers with persistent adverse behavioral traits (e.g., limited spending, excessive revenue reversals, excessive service requests, promotion purchase behavior) engage in cross-buying, they exhibit a downward spiral of unprofitable relationship, with the losses increasing with higher levels of cross-buy. The authors analyze the customer databases of five firms and find that 10%–35% of the firms' customers who cross-buy are unprofitable and account for a significant proportion (39%–88%) of the firms' total loss from its customers. Consequently, the authors present a two-stage framework to enable managers to discern customers who are likely to engage in profitable versus unprofitable cross-buying. Overall, the findings refine the basic understanding of the cross-buy phenomenon and motivate managers to rethink their marketing practices and policies, which are typically designed to maximize cross-buy opportunities for every customer.

304,"The authors propose a conceptual framework to explain whether and when the introduction of a new retail store channel helps or hurts sales in existing direct channels. A conceptual framework separates short- and long-term effects by analyzing the capabilities of a channel that help consumers accomplish their shopping goals. To test the theory, the authors analyze a unique data set from a high-end retailer using matching methods. The authors study the introduction of a retail store and find evidence of cross-channel cannibalization and synergy. The presence of a retail store decreases sales in the catalog but not the Internet channel in the short run but increases sales in both direct channels over time. Following the opening of the store, more first-time customers begin purchasing in the direct channels. These results suggest that adding a retail store to direct channels yields different results from adding an Internet channel to a retail store channel, as previous research has indicated.

305,"Although downsizing has become a nearly universal managerial practice, many downsizing initiatives fail. To explain this phenomenon, previous research has mainly investigated possible negative consequences for employees remaining in the firm while largely neglecting customer reactions to downsizing and the issues surrounding its implementation. The authors describe three studies analyzing how downsizing at a firm's point of customer contact affects customers and how managers can influence customer reactions through open communication. The first study, a manager study, is based on an executive survey of a sample of more than 100 downsizing projects. The other two studies are customer studies that use an experimental scenario method. Across the two methods, results show that the extent of downsizing is linked to customer uncertainty. In addition, both survey results and experimental results reveal that open downsizing communication carries substantial risks for downsizing firms. Although open communication reduces customer uncertainty if customers have strong informal ties with the firm's employees or perceive a firm's products as important, it may increase customer uncertainty in other situations.

306,"Drawing on the chain-of-effects model as a unifying framework, this meta-analysis indicates that firm innovativeness indirectly affects firm value through its effects on market position and financial position. In addition, the findings suggest that innovativeness has direct positive effects on financial position and firm value. Moreover, the meta-analysis provides evidence of reverse causality in the innovativeness–firm value relationship. Importantly, the results also reveal that the positive effects of firm innovativeness on market position and financial position are stronger for larger firms, for firms that invest more in advertising, for firms in high-tech industries, for innovativeness outputs and for radical innovations. Finally, the meta-analytic evidence also indicates that the relationship between innovativeness and firm value is stronger for smaller firms, for firms that invest more in advertising, for firms in low-tech industries, for innovativeness inputs, for innovativeness culture, and for radical innovations.
",We examine the impact of firm-level information technology (IT) on firm-level innovation. We find that firms with higher IT-related firm-level innovation are more likely to innovate in the presence of higher firm-level IT-related firm-level innovation. We also find that firms with higher IT-related firm-level innovation are more likely to innovate in the presence of higher firm-level IT-related firm-level innovation. We also find that firms with higher IT-related firm-level innovation are more likely to innovate in the presence of higher firm-level IT-related firm-level innovation. Our findings suggest that firms with higher IT-related firm-level innovation are more likely to innovate in the presence of higher firm-level IT-related firm-level innovation. Our findings contribute to the literature on firm-level innovation and provide important managerial implications for firms that are faced with uncertain firm-level IT-related firm-level innovation.  We discuss implications for the management of firms that are faced with uncertain firm-level IT-related firm-level innovation.  10/11/17  \  11/18/17  \  11/18/17  \  11/18/17  \,0.34457064,-2.029961,-1.7971548,-0.1962242,-0.45901337,-0.833089,-0.26461387,0.55031395,-0.47502443,0.27951393,1.6511444,0.2759967,-0.99045944,-0.7637931,-0.1607144,-0.20440727,-0.49942124,0.8956431,-1.8321757,1.9745746,1.2982891,0.7355196,0.146416,-0.7719816,0.27572146,-0.85032225,0.3700172,0.07711569,0.025325324,-0.74203247,-0.20128737,-0.021549456,-0.20224096,-1.3247869,-1.8289543,0.87390643,0.19397229,1.7044446,-0.63297737,0.67158026,0.8249456,-0.5855908,0.18279092,-0.30959806,-0.00294215,-0.7751694,-1.0295419,-0.24871051,1.036371,1.2409681,0.87367797,-1.1754706,1.0897822,1.9738344,-0.3248231,0.71959424,1.0209666,-0.74452394,-1.4723588,0.18357633,0.6466705,1.891834,0.9759141,-0.80739385,-0.14772011,-1.4448028,1.1901289,-1.108974,-0.86308324,1.7179438,0.17709926,2.414304,0.483311,-2.521654,-1.6603347,0.6610909,0.092895254,1.5347029,0.00848516,0.6724076,1.466136,-1.841991,0.023125872,0.99110824,0.055498615,2.642211,1.0128132,-0.80029845,-2.2764232,-1.1797353,-0.4649809,1.1473187,-0.97674626,0.3784913,0.9320248,-0.63838524,-2.065321,-0.38297153,0.92474955,0.99717903,0.58305764,-0.6308311,1.2701854,-0.10305155,1.0247215,0.13399333,-0.7763988,0.58776885,-1.0134493,-0.0932755,-0.19770339,0.2688287,2.32349,-1.1123828,1.5380826,0.19665764,1.4732857,0.68102044,-0.047961544,2.6152272,-0.36483976,0.27556297,-0.25058153,-0.749861,-1.9795563,-0.7248119,-0.383675,-1.4476342
307,"Quality is a central element in business strategy and academic research. Despite important research on quality, an opportunity for an integrative framework remains. The authors present an integrative framework of quality that captures how firms and customers produce quality (the quality production process), how firms deliver and customers experience quality (the quality experience process), and how customers evaluate quality (the quality evaluation process). The framework extends the literature in several ways. First, the authors describe important linkages between the three processes, including links reflecting the role of co-production. Second, they point to overlooked aspects of the quality processes that influence how quality is conceptualized and should be managed. These include customer heterogeneity in measurement knowledge and motivation; the role of emotion in quality production, experience, and evaluation; and a new typology of attributes. Third, they propose a quality state residing within each quality process and describe what gives rise to these states, which will enhance decision makers’ ability to measure and manage quality processes. Finally, they offer theoretical and managerial implications derived from their integrative quality framework including 20 strategies to increase customer satisfaction.

308,"As interfirm collaboration plays an increasingly important role in firm innovation, many firms are engaged in multiple partnerships, forming portfolios of alliances. Research in marketing has predominantly focused on dyadic relationships without considering the important interdependencies among different alliances. This study takes a portfolio approach to examine the resource diversity of multiple alliance partners and its contribution to firm innovation. The authors argue that resource diversity in an alliance portfolio can only benefit innovation when resources and information are shared across alliances. They examine factors that may facilitate or inhibit information and resource sharing across alliances and thus influence the realization of any benefit of portfolio resource diversity. The model identifies various factors along three dimensions, including the composition of an alliance portfolio, alliance management, and the market environment, that moderate the relationship between alliance portfolio resource diversity and firm innovation. This study not only demonstrates the conditions for a firm to benefit from diverse partners but also highlights the importance of coordination among different alliances, suggesting a portfolio approach for alliance research.

309,"The authors investigate the relationships between brand equity and customer acquisition, retention, and profit margin, the key components of customer lifetime value (CLV). They examine a unique database from the U.S. automobile market that combines ten years of acquisition rate, retention rate, and customer profitability data with measures of brand equity from Young & Rubicam's Brand Asset Valuator (BAV) over the same period. They hypothesize and find that BAV brand equity is significantly associated with the components of CLV in expected and meaningful ways. For example, customer knowledge of a brand has an especially strong positive relationship with all three components of CLV. Notably, however, differentiation is a double-edged sword. While it is associated with higher customer profitability, it is also associated with lower acquisition and retention rates. The authors also find that marketing efforts exert indirect impacts on CLV through brand equity. Simulations show that changes in marketing, or exogenous changes in brand equity, can exert important effects on CLV. Overall, the findings suggest that the “soft” and “hard” sides of marketing need to be managed in a coordinated way. The authors conclude with a discussion of these and other implications for researchers and practitioners.

310,"The interpretation of a percentage change often hinges on the base value to which it is attached. The authors identify a tendency among consumers to neglect base values when processing percentage change information and investigate the implications of such base value neglect for how consumers evaluate economically equivalent offers presented in percentage terms, such as bonus packs and price discounts. The authors first document a substantial advantage in sales volume for a bonus pack over an economically equivalent price discount in a field experiment conducted in a retail store. Furthermore, in a mall-intercept survey and multiple lab studies, the authors provide additional evidence in support of the effect and identify managerially useful boundary conditions for when the effect is likely to manifest. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.

311,"Consumers often dispose of used products by selling them in a secondary market (e.g., classified advertisements, Craigslist, eBay). When consumers must dispose of products to which they feel emotionally attached, they often expect to sell the product at a price in excess of its market value. However, the authors identify a condition in which product attachment can decrease rather than increase the minimum price sellers are willing to accept. Specifically, they propose that due to concern for how products are used following a transaction, strongly attached sellers may be more willing than weakly attached sellers to provide discounts to potential buyers whose usage intentions are deemed appropriate. Whereas prior research has focused primarily on one particular consequence of attachment, namely, the intensified reluctance of consumers to part with their possessions, this research identifies a novel consequence of attachment: a heightened sensitivity to the manner in which the product will be used following a transaction. Four empirical studies provide converging evidence that sellers’ product attachment determines the extent to which their minimum acceptable sales price is influenced by buyer usage intent.

312,"Global brands are faced with the challenge of conveying concepts that not only are consistent across borders but also resonate with consumers of different cultures. Building on prior research indicating that abstract brand concepts induce more favorable consumer responses than functional attributes, the authors introduce a generalizable and robust structure of abstract brand concepts as representations of human values. Using three empirical studies conducted with respondents from eight countries, they demonstrate that this proposed structure is particularly useful for predicting (1) brand meanings that are compatible (vs. incompatible) with each other and, consequently, more (less) favorably accepted by consumers when added to an already established brand concept; (2) brand concepts that are more likely to resonate with consumers with differing cultural orientations; and (3) consumers’ responses to attempts to imbue an established brand concept with new, (in)compatible abstract meanings as a function of their own cultural orientations.
","We propose that the value of a product’s value depends on its perceived value to consumers. We propose that value is a function of the perceived value of the product’s product, and value is a function of the perceived value of the product’s product’s perceived value to consumers.

313,"Sharing systems are increasingly challenging sole ownership as the dominant means of obtaining product benefits, making up a market estimated at more than US$100 billion annually in 2010. Consumer options include cell phone minute-sharing plans, frequent-flyer-mile pools, bicycle-sharing programs, and automobile-sharing systems, among many others. However, marketing research has yet to provide a framework for understanding and managing these emergent systems. The authors conceptualize commercial sharing systems within a typology of shared goods. Using three studies, they demonstrate that beyond cost-related benefits of sharing, the perceived risk of scarcity related to sharing is a central determinant of its attractiveness. The results suggest that managers can use perceptions of personal and sharing partners’ usage patterns to affect risk perceptions and subsequent propensity to participate in a commercial sharing system.

314,"Spurred by the consumer demand for companies to be socially responsible, cause-related marketing (CM), in which fund raising for a cause is tied to purchase of a firm's products, has become popular in recent years. The authors demonstrate the conditions in which CM campaigns that allow consumers to choose the cause that receives the donation lead to greater consumer support than those in which the company determines the cause. They show that choice in this context is helpful as long as it increases consumers’ perception of personal role in helping the cause. Specifically, allowing consumers to select the cause in a CM campaign is more likely to enhance perceived personal role and, thus, purchase intentions (1) for those consumers who are high (vs. low) in collectivism and (2) when the company and causes have low (vs. high) perceptual fit. Finally, the authors show that under certain conditions, choice may have a negative impact on perceived personal role and consumer support of CM campaigns.
",We study the impact of consumer information on the purchase decision of a product. We find that consumers’ perceptions of the quality of the product are positively related to the product’s price and the product’s price-per-unit (PPU) and the product’s price-per-unit (PPU) of the product. The positive relationship between the quality of the product and the price-per-unit of the product is stronger for products with higher prices and higher PPU. The negative relationship between the quality of the product and the price-per-unit of the product is stronger for products with lower prices and lower PPU. We also find that consumers’ perceptions of the quality of the product are positively related to the product’s price and the product’s price-per-unit of the product. We also find that consumers’ perceptions of the quality of the product are positively related to the product’s price and the product�s price-per-unit of the product.

315,"The authors examine the relative magnitude of price reductions for product systems and their constituent components (e.g., cameras, computers, monitors, lenses) and hypothesize that these price reductions systematically vary across different types of systems. The authors offer rational inattention as an explanation and document patterns of downward rigidity in online prices of computers and cameras that are consistent with this view. Their basic argument is that under certain circumstances, it is rational for consumers to ignore small price changes. This results in some price rigidity because firms would see no demand effect for small reductions. The authors suggest that this inattention systematically varies across different types of multicomponent systems, leading to specific hypotheses about sellers’ pricing behavior. They first check the validity of their theoretical arguments using data from two surveys of consumers and managers. They then examine 669,557 daily price listings for 1052 high-end cameras and computers from 102 online vendors and find evidence consistent with their predictions. Using publicly available web traffic data, the authors also find that their predicted pricing behavior is aligned with better traffic response for the firm.

316,"The authors study consumer perceptions of firms that sell products designed by users. In contrast with the traditional design mode, in which professional designers employed by firms handle the design task, common design by users involves the firm's user community in creating new product designs for the broader consumer market. In the course of four studies, the authors find that common design by users does not decrease but actually enhances consumers’ perceptions of a firm's innovation ability. This “innovation effect of user design” leads to positive outcomes with respect to purchase intentions, willingness to pay, and consumers’ willingness to recommend the firm to others. The authors identify four defining characteristics of common design by users that underlie this innovation inference; namely, the number of consumers, the diversity of their background, the lack of company constraints, and the fact that consumer designers actually use the designed product all contribute in building positive perceptions. Finally, the authors identify consumer familiarity with user innovation and the design task's complexity as important moderators that create boundary conditions for the innovation effect of user design.

317,"Although there is literature on how top executives’ compensation influences general management decisions, relatively little is known about whether and how compensation influences advertising and research-and-development (R&D) spending decisions. This study addresses two questions. First, is there an incentive effect of long- versus short-term compensation on advertising and R&D spending? Second, is there a mediation effect of advertising and R&D spending on the relationship between long- versus short-term compensation and stock market return? The authors address these questions using a combination of ExecuComp, Compustat, and Center for Research in Security Prices data on 842 firms during the 1993–2005 period. They find that an increase in the equity to bonus compensation ratio is positively associated with an increase in advertising and R&D spending as a share of sales. Advertising and R&D spending as a share of sales also mediates the effect of equity to bonus ratio on stock market return. The authors discuss implications for top management seeking to mitigate myopic management of resources by employing compensation to incentivize a longer-term orientation for advertising and R&D spending to improve stock return.

318,"Although pricing is one of the strongest drivers of profitability, little empirical research has examined how a firm should organize pricing internally. This research draws on the information-processing view of organizational design to conceptualize a framework of how firms organize their pricing authority both within the sales function and across the sales, marketing, and finance functions. The authors find a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped relationship between the vertical delegation of pricing authority and profitability as well as a positive relationship between the horizontal dispersion of pricing authority across sales, marketing, and finance and profitability. Another key finding is a positive interaction between vertical delegation and horizontal dispersion, indicating that firms need to jointly design vertical delegation and horizontal dispersion. In addition, the results identify price-related market dynamism as a moderator of the horizontal dispersion of the pricing authority–profitability relationship and emphasis on margin-based incentives as a moderator of vertical delegation of the pricing authority–profitability relationship. The authors also analyze the relationship between the organizational design of pricing authority and sales growth.

319,"Websites prominently display consumers’ product ratings, which influence consumers’ buying decisions and willingness to pay. Few insights exist regarding whether a consumer's online product rating is prone to social influence from others’ online ratings. Examining this issue, the authors hypothesize that other consumers’ online ratings moderate the effects of positive and regular negative features of product experience, product failure, and product recovery (to address product failure) on the reviewer's online product rating. The results from a model using 7499 consumers’ online ratings of 114 hotels support the hypotheses. Other consumers’ online ratings weaken the effects of positive and regular negative features of product experience but can either exacerbate or overturn the negative effect of product failure, depending on the quality of product recovery. For marketing theory, the findings indicate that consumers who influence others are themselves influenced by other consumers and that this influence is contingent on their product experience. For managerial practice, the authors offer a method to estimate the effects of product experience characteristics on online product ratings and show that social influence effects make high online product ratings a double-edged sword, exacerbating the negative effect of product failure and strengthening the benefit of product recovery.

320,"Because hedonic products consist predominantly of experience attributes, often with many available alternatives, choosing the “right” one is a demanding task for consumers. Decision making becomes even more difficult when a group, instead of an individual consumer, will consume the product, as is regularly the case for hedonic offerings such as movies, opera performances, and wine. Noting the prevalence of automated recommender systems as decision aids, the authors investigate the power of group recommender systems that consider the preferences of all group members. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative. However, when agents choose freely among alternatives, the group's social relationship quality determines whether group recommenders actually create higher group value. Finally, group recommenders outperform decision making without automated recommendations if the agent's intention to use the systems is high. A decision tree model of recommender usage offers guidance to hedonic product managers.
","We study the decision-making process of a consumer choice task in a market where consumers are heterogeneous in their preferences for products. We propose a model that allows consumers to choose products based on their preferences. We propose a model that allows consumers to choose products based on their preferences. We show that consumers’ preferences are influenced by the product’s characteristics, such as the product’s price, the product’s quality, and the product’s price-performance. We also show that consumers’ preferences are influenced by the product’s price-performance, which is the product’s price-performance-dependent effect.

321,"To limit costs associated with product returns, some online retailers have instituted equity-based return shipping policies, requiring customers to pay to return products when retailers determine that customers are at fault. The authors compare the normative assumptions about customers that underlie equity-based return shipping policies with the more realistic, positivist expectations as predicted by attribution, equity, and regret theories. Two longitudinal field studies over four years using two surveys and actual customer spending data indicate that retailer confidence in those normative assumptions is unjustified. Contrary to retailer assumptions, neither the positive consequences of free returns nor the negative consequences of fee returns were reversed when customer perceptions of fairness were taken into account. Depending on the locus and extent of blame, customers who paid for their own return decreased their postreturn spending at that retailer 75%–100% by the end of two years. In contrast, returns that were free to the consumer resulted in postreturn customer spending that was 158%–457% of prereturn spending. The findings suggest that online retailers should either institute a policy of free product returns or, at a minimum, examine their customer data to determine their customers’ responses to fee returns.

322,"The results from three studies suggest that consumers’ perceptions of product effectiveness are critical in determining the amount of a product they choose to use in a given instance. In general, consumers consider green, or environmentally friendly, products to be less effective than regular products; therefore, consumers increase the amount of the green product they use to make up for the perceived inferiority. Notably, this pattern of green versus regular product usage is more pronounced among consumers who are environmentally conscious. When the perceived effectiveness of a green product is boosted by a credible endorsement, the discrepancy between green and regular product usage disappears.

323,"This article introduces customer stewardship control (CSC) to the marketing field. This concept represents a frontline employee's felt ownership of and moral responsibility for customers’ overall welfare. In two studies, the authors show that CSC is a more encompassing construct than customer orientation, which reflects a frontline employee's focus on meeting customers’ needs. They provide evidence that the former is more potent in shaping in- and extra-role employee behaviors. Moreover, they highlight how CSC operates in conjunction with an organization's agency control system: Stewardship's positive influence on in- and extra-role behavior is weaker in the presence of high agency control. They offer actionable advice about how to solve the resulting managerial control dilemma. Finally, the authors show that CSC depends on drivers that reside at the individual level (employee relatedness), the team level (team competence), or both levels of aggregation (employee and team autonomy). These findings show how to effectively design a frontline employee's work environment to ensure optimal frontline performance.

324,"Foreign branding—or using brand names that evoke foreign associations through, for example, spelling a brand name in a foreign language—is a popular means in both developed and emerging countries of suggesting a specific country of origin (COO) in the hope that it will evoke certain product qualities. As a result, consumers increasingly encounter products with brand names that imply a COO that differs from the actual COO (where the product is manufactured). In four experiments, the authors find support for the hypothesis that incongruence between the actual COO and implied COO decreases purchase likelihood asymmetrically. Incongruence backfires in hedonic categories but has hardly any effect in utilitarian categories. Furthermore, incongruence decreases purchase likelihood more if the actual COO is an emerging rather than developed country. The authors address the psychological process underlying the asymmetric effect of incongruence by showing that consumers apply different information-processing strategies to hedonic versus utilitarian products. These results have important implications for (foreign) branding decisions.

325,"While organizational identity can be a powerful tool for mobilizing and directing organizational members, the authors’ findings demonstrate that it can also constrain the process of foreign market adaptation. Drawing from extensive ethnographic fieldwork in India, where they followed several multinational companies, they show how well-entrenched and enduring identities can obstruct the learning and strategic adjustments that are necessary to appeal to consumers in a new market environment. By explaining how organizational identity comes into play as a frame of reference and guiding principle, orienting managers in their efforts to preserve the character of their firm as it expands and globalizes, this research offers new insights into foreign market learning and adaptation. The authors extend this analysis to provide valuable recommendations to managers for making organizational identity a more explicit component of global marketing strategy.

326,"Using actor-network theory from sociology, the author explores the creation of new markets as a brand-mediated legitimation process. Findings from an eight-year longitudinal investigation of the Botox Cosmetic brand suggest that the meanings of a new cosmetic self-enhancement technology evolve over the course of contestations between brand images promoted by the innovator and doppelgänger brand images promoted by other stakeholders. Each contestation addresses an enduring contradiction between nature and technology. A four-step brand image revitalization process is offered that can be applied either by managers interested in fostering an innovation's congruence with prevailing social norms and ideals or by other stakeholders (e.g., activists, competitors) interested in undermining its marketing success. The findings integrate previously disparate research streams on branding and market creation and provide managers with the conceptual tools for sustaining a branded innovation's legitimacy over time.
","The emergence of digital platforms as a new form of digital innovation has sparked a renewed interest in the role of digital platforms in the development of digital innovation.

327,"Frontline service employees frequently encounter customers’ fuzzy requests, defined as requests that are slightly or somewhat outside company policy but not completely unacceptable or detrimental to the company. Employees’ compliance decisions can profoundly affect customers, organizations, and employees themselves. However, the complex decision process in which service employees engage is largely unexplored. The authors draw from script and motivated reasoning theories, as well as qualitative interviews, to model employees’ responses to customers’ fuzzy requests in a retail setting. The results, which are based on a national survey of retail employees, indicate that employees with higher customer orientation and higher conflict avoidance tend to handle fuzzy return requests in a friendlier, more effortful manner, especially when customers demonstrate an affiliative style. In contrast, when customers display a dominant style, employees engage in motivated reasoning and perceive the request to be less legitimate, reducing their likelihood of complying. In addition, the employees’ perceived flexibility influences their compliance decisions, but punishment expectations do not. The authors conclude with some managerial implications, including better identification of these requests and more training of employees to handle them appropriately.

328,"The marketing literature typically argues that customers cannot easily be involved with, and contribute to, the creation of major innovation (MI). This article finds otherwise. The authors use an inductive process method to study how six MIs were developed for business-to-business markets by small and young technology firms. Three of the MIs were successful, and three failed. The firms with MI success are distinguished by a nonconventional new product development process that includes five iterative and overlapping activities and up to ten different customer roles. These activities and roles are captured in a multifaceted taxonomy of customer participation. The analysis also uncovers three capabilities relevant to the development of successful MI—capabilities that are effectual rather than adaptive in nature.

329,"By 2011, approximately 83% of Fortune 500 companies were using some form of social media to connect with consumers. Furthermore, surveys suggest that consumers are increasingly relying on social media to learn about unfamiliar brands. However, best practices regarding the use of social media to bolster brand evaluations in such situations remain undefined. This research focuses on one practice in this domain: the decision to hide or reveal the demographic characteristics of a brand's online supporters. The results from four studies indicate that even when the presence of these supporters is only passively experienced and virtual (a situation the authors term “mere virtual presence”), their demographic characteristics can influence a target consumer's brand evaluations and purchase intentions. The findings suggest a framework for brand managers to use when deciding whether to reveal the identities of their online supporters or to retain ambiguity according to (1) the composition of existing supporters relative to targeted new supporters and (2) whether the brand is likely to be evaluated singly or in combination with competing brands.
","We examine the impact of online advertising on consumers’ perceptions of brands and brands’ perceived value. We find that brands are more likely to advertise on social media platforms, such as Facebook, than on traditional channels, such as Twitter, and that brands are more likely to advertise on social media platforms that are more likely to be viewed by consumers. We also find that brands are more likely to advertise on social media platforms that are more likely to be viewed by consumers. We also find that brands are more likely to advertise on social media platforms that are more likely to be viewed by consumers. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of online advertising platforms and the design of online advertising platforms.

330,"Extant research confirms the importance of value cocreation through customer participation (CP), but relatively little is known about whether and how it creates an enjoyable experience for customers and service employees and the consequential outcomes of this positive affective experience. This study applies the concept of flow as an overarching framework and draws theoretical support from social cognitive theory, particularly its extension (i.e., the conceptual model of relational efficacy beliefs), to examine how customers and employees derive enjoyment from CP conditional on their perceived efficacy of themselves (self-efficacy [SE]) and their partners (other-efficacy [OE]) in financial services. Empirical results from 223 client–financial adviser dyads confirm that participation enjoyment, in addition to economic and relational values, mediates the impact of CP on participants’ satisfaction evaluations, with SE positively moderating CP's impact on participation enjoyment. The synergistic effect of SE and OE on participation enjoyment also differs for clients versus financial advisers: Even incongruent levels of SE and OE can enhance participation enjoyment as long as they help validate role expectations of the respective participants.

331,"The capability level of a product that a firm provides to a customer is an important marketing decision. In the extant literature, the normative heuristic for this decision is one of matching—of providing product capability levels that meet customer needs. However, industry evidence suggests that supplier firms routinely make product decisions that lead to “overshot” customers, whereby customers receive products with capabilities that exceed their requirements. The authors demonstrate how a supplier firm's organizational culture can cause overshooting scenarios and how these effects can be attenuated to the extent that the focal firm's basic values also reflect a customer orientation.

332,"The dynamic components of relational constructs should play an important role in driving performance. To take an initial step toward a theory of relationship dynamics, the authors introduce the construct of commitment velocity—or the rate and direction of change in commitment—and articulate its important role in understanding relationships. In two studies, the authors demonstrate that commitment velocity has a strong impact on performance, beyond the impact of the level of commitment. In Study 1, modeling six years of longitudinal data in a latent growth curve analysis, the authors empirically demonstrate the significance of commitment velocity as a predictor of performance. In Study 2, the authors use matched multiple-source data to investigate the drivers of commitment velocity. Both customer trust and dynamic capabilities for creating value through exchange relationships (i.e., communication capabilities for exploring and investment capabilities for exploiting opportunities) affect commitment velocity. However, trust and communication capabilities become less impactful as a relationship ages, while investment capabilities grow more important. The authors offer three post hoc tenets that represent initial components of a theory of relationship dynamics that integrates two streams of relationship marketing research into a unified perspective.

333,"Higher sales and margins are key goals for retailers promoting emerging products, such as organics, but little is known about their marketing effectiveness and their cross-effects on conventional product sales. Extant research reports conflicting results about price and promotional sensitivity for organic products and does not address the impact of organic assortment. This article calculates long-term own- and cross-elasticities of organic and conventional product sales in response to changes in assortment, price, and promotions. Using a rich data set of 56 categories, the authors test hypotheses on how different costs and benefits of organic products affect these elasticities. They find that enduring actions, such as assortment and regular price changes, have a higher elasticity for organics than for conventional products. In contrast with common wisdom, even “core” organic consumers are sensitive to these actions. Increasing organic assortment and promotion breadth yields higher profits for the total category, as do more frequent promotions on conventional products. The category comparison yields specific advice with regard to where larger assortment and lower prices versus more and deeper promotions are most effective.

334,"The sales lead black hole—the 70% of leads generated by marketing departments that sales representatives do not pursue—may result from competing demands on sales reps' time. Using the motivation–opportunity–ability framework, the authors consider factors that influence sales reps' pursuit (or lack thereof) of marketing and self-generated leads. The proportion of time that sales reps devote to marketing leads depends on organizational lead prequalification and managerial tracking processes (extrinsic motivation), as well as marketing lead volume (opportunity), and sales rep experience and performance (ability). Consistent with a person–situation framework, individual sales rep factors should also moderate the influence of organizational processes on lead follow-up. Data from 461 sales reps employed by four firms confirm that as sales reps' experience increases, their responses to managerial tracking of lead follow-up and marketing lead volume decrease; responses to the quality of the lead prequalification process increase. As sales reps' performance improves, their response to the volume of marketing leads increases, but their response to managerial tracking decreases. The interplay of individual sales reps' abilities and organizational marketing and sales processes explains differences in sales reps' follow-up of marketing leads.’

335,"It is common for business-to-business firms to use references from client firms when trying to influence prospects to become new customers. In this study, the authors define the concept of business reference value (BRV) as the ability of a client's reference to influence prospects to purchase and the degree to which it does so. They develop a three-step method to compute BRV for a given client using a retrospective reported measure of reference value. Next, they use data from a financial services and a telecommunications firm to identify and empirically test the drivers of BRV. These drivers fall into four categories: (1) length of client relationship, (2) client firm size, (3) reference media format, and (4) reference congruency. Next, the authors empirically show that clients that have the highest BRV are not the same as the clients that have the highest customer lifetime value. They also show that an average client that is high on BRV has significantly different characteristics from the average client that is low on BRV. Finally, they derive implications for managing BRV.
","We examine the relationship between the value of a firm's online presence and its market share. We use a unique data set of 1,973 U.S. firms to examine the relationship between their online presence and their market share.

We also find that firms with lower online presence are more likely to be profitable and to be more profitable than firms with higher market share. We also find that firms with higher market share are more likely to be profitable and to be more profitable than firms with lower market share. We also find that firms with higher market share are more likely to be profitable and to be more profitable than firms with lower market share. We also find that firms with higher market share are more likely to be profitable and to be more profitable than firms with lower market share.

336,"Customers increasingly rely on other consumers' reviews to make purchase decisions online. New insights into the customer review phenomenon can be derived from studying the semantic content and style properties of verbatim customer reviews to examine their influence on online retail sites' conversion rates. The authors employ text mining to extract changes in affective content and linguistic style properties of customer book reviews on Amazon.com. A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group's typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates. These findings suggest that managers should identify and promote the most influential reviews in a given product category, provide instructions to stimulate reviewers to write powerful reviews, and adapt the style of their own editorial reviews to the relevant product category.

337,"The market share of brands positioned using ethical attributes typically lags behind brands that promote attributes related to product performance. Across four studies, the authors show that situational factors that heighten consumers' self-accountability (i.e., activation of their desire to live up to their self-standards) lead to increased preferences for products promoted through their ethical attributes. They investigate their predictions regarding self-accountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management. Taken together, the results suggest that marketers positioning products through ethical attributes should subtly activate consumer self-accountability rather than using more explicit guilt appeals.

338,"Firms often look for ways to improve the return on investment they earn from costly innovation strategies. The authors investigate a previously unexplored benefit of innovation that occurs when a brand's reputation as a provider of valued new offerings allows it to earn innovation credit, a form of customer-based brand equity. Innovation credit provides brands with the license or latitude to use strategies that violate category norms without the penalty (in the form of impaired attitudes) that consumers are shown to levy on less innovative brands. Consistent with the proposed theoretical framework, three studies demonstrate that innovative brands are granted the license to employ nonnormative strategies without sanction. In addition to providing evidence regarding the inferential mechanism underlying this licensing effect, Study 3 shows that, under certain conditions, innovative brands not only escape the penalty associated with using atypical strategies but are actually rewarded for utilizing such approaches. The authors provide theoretical and managerial implications of these findings and suggestions for further research in this emerging area of innovation research.

339,"Typically, shoppers’ paths only cover less than half of the areas in a grocery store. Given that shoppers often use physical products in the store as external memory cues, encouraging shoppers to travel more of the store may increase unplanned spending. Estimating the direct effect of in-store travel distance on unplanned spending, however, is complicated by the difficulty of collecting in-store path data and the endogeneity of in-store travel distance. To address both issues, the authors collect a novel data set using in-store radio frequency identification tracking and develop an instrumental variable approach to account for endogeneity. Their analysis reveals that the elasticity of unplanned spending on travel distance is 57% higher than the uncorrected ordinary least squares estimate. Simulations based on the authors’ estimates suggest that strategically promoting three product categories through mobile promotion could increase unplanned spending by 16.1%, compared with the estimated effect of a benchmark strategy based on relocating three destination categories (7.2%). Furthermore, the authors conduct a field experiment to assess the effectiveness of mobile promotions and find that a coupon that required shoppers to travel farther from their planned path resulted in a substantial increase in unplanned spending ($21.29) over a coupon for an unplanned category near their planned path ($13.83). The results suggest that targeted mobile promotions aimed at increasing in-store path length can increase unplanned spending.

340,"To increase marketing's accountability, Journal of Marketing, Marketing Science Institute, and the Institute for the Study of Business Markets have advocated development of marketing metrics and linking marketing-mix activities with financial metrics. Although the marketing field has made progress, researchers have paid less attention to what drives managerial use of marketing and financial metrics and whether metric use is associated with marketing-mix performance. The authors propose a conceptual model that links firm strategy, metric orientation, type of marketing-mix activity, and managerial, firm, and environmental characteristics to marketing and financial metric use, which in turn are linked to performance of marketing-mix activities. An analysis of 1287 marketing-mix activities reported by 439 U.S. managers reveals that firm strategy, metric orientation, type of marketing-mix activity, and firm and environmental characteristics are more useful than managerial characteristics in explaining use of marketing and financial metrics and that use of metrics is positively associated with marketing-mix performance. The results help identify conditions under which managers use fewer metrics and how metric use can be increased to improve marketing-mix performance.

341,"Although the goal of a product recall program is to enhance safety, little is known about whether firms learn from product recalls. This study tests the direct effect of product recalls on future accidents and future recall frequency and their indirect effect through future product reliability in the automobile industry. The authors test the hypotheses on 459 make/year observations involving 27 automobile makers between 1995 and 2011. The findings suggest that increases in recall magnitude lead to decreases in future number of injuries and recalls. This effect, in turn, is partially mediated by future changes in product reliability. The results also suggest that the positive relationship between recall magnitude and future product reliability is (1) stronger for firms with higher shared product assets and (2) weaker for brands of higher prior quality. The findings are robust across alternate measures and alternate model specifications and offer valuable insights for managerial practice and public policy.

342,"Product-harm crises are omnipresent in today's marketplace. Such crises can cause major revenue and market-share losses, lead to costly product recalls, and destroy carefully nurtured brand equity. Moreover, some of these effects may spill over to nonaffected competitors in the category when they are perceived to be guilty by association. The extant literature lacks generalizable knowledge on the effectiveness of different marketing adjustments that managers often consider to mitigate the consequences of such events. To fill this gap, the authors use large household-scanner panels to analyze 60 fast-moving consumer good product crises that occurred in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands and resulted in the full recall of an entire variety. The authors assess the effects of postcrisis advertising and price adjustments on the change in consumers’ brand share and category purchases. In addition, they consider the extent to which the effects are moderated by two key crisis characteristics: the extent of negative publicity surrounding the event and whether the affected brand had to publicly acknowledge blame. Using the empirical findings, the authors provide context-specific managerial recommendations on how to overcome a product-harm crisis.

343,"The authors explore how injunctive appeals (i.e., highlighting what others think one should do), descriptive appeals (i.e., highlighting what others are doing), and benefit appeals (i.e., highlighting the benefits of the action) can encourage consumers to engage in relatively unfamiliar sustainable behaviors such as “grasscycling” and composting. Across one field study and three laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of the appeal type depends on whether the individual or collective level of the self is activated. When the collective level of self is activated, injunctive and descriptive normative appeals are most effective, whereas benefit appeals are less effective in encouraging sustainable behaviors. When the individual level of self is activated, self-benefit and descriptive appeals are particularly effective. The positive effects of descriptive appeals for the individual self are related to the informational benefits that such appeals can provide. The authors propose a goal-compatibility mechanism for these results and find that a match of congruent goals leads to the most positive consumer responses. They conclude with a discussion of implications for consumers, marketers, and public policy makers.

344,"Consumers tend to have more favorable attitudes for their in-group brands than their out-group brands. However, little is known regarding how brand managers can overcome consumers’ negative attitudes toward out-group brands. Drawing on the moral identity literature, the authors theorize that moral identity may enhance out-group (but not in-group) brand attitudes through decreased psychological distance. Four studies demonstrate that moral identity increases out-group brand attitudes. The authors also identify two important boundary conditions of this moral identity effect. These findings suggest that brand managers who want to overcome the less-than-favorable perceptions associated with out-group brands may benefit from drawing on consumers’ moral identity in marketing communications. Theoretically, this research establishes that moral identity extends beyond prosocial behaviors to influence marketplace judgments (i.e., brand attitudes and categorization).

345,"The authors provide a framework to predict when uncertainty will have a beneficial or detrimental impact on marketing promotions involving free gifts. Whereas uncertainty (i.e., not knowing which free gift will be offered) decreases purchase likelihood when the decision is cognitive, it increases purchase likelihood when the decision is affective. Using field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that when the decision involves affect, people like to be surprised and appreciate uncertainty in the purchase process. When the decision is cognitive, consumers appreciate having information about the product offer. This research has both theoretical implications for research on affect and uncertainty and practical implications for marketing managers designing and implementing promotional campaigns.

346,"The authors integrate research on impulsivity from the psychology area with standard economic theories of consumer demand to make novel predictions about the effects of market price changes on consumers’ food consumption behavior. The results from multiple studies confirm that consumers exhibit undesirable asymmetric patterns of demand sensitivity to price changes for healthy and unhealthy food. For healthy food, demand sensitivity is greater for a price increase than for a price decrease. For unhealthy food, the opposite holds true. The research further shows that the undesirable patterns are attenuated or magnified for key policy-relevant factors that have been shown to decrease or increase impulsive purchase behavior, respectively. As the rising obesity trend brings American consumers’ food consumption behavior under increased scrutiny, the focal findings hold significant implications for both public policy makers and food marketers.

347,"Traditionally, the value of a product has been assessed according to the direct revenues the product creates. However, products do not exist in isolation but rather influence one another's sales. Such influence is especially evident in e-commerce environments, in which products are often presented as a collection of web pages linked by recommendation hyperlinks, creating a large-scale product network. The authors present a systematic approach to estimate products’ true value to a firm in such a product network. Their approach, which is in the spirit of the PageRank algorithm, uses available data from large-scale e-commerce sites and separates a product's value into its own intrinsic value, the value it receives from the network, and the value it contributes to the network. The authors demonstrate their approach using data collected from the product network of books on Amazon.com. Specifically, they show that the value of low sellers may be underestimated, whereas the value of best sellers may be overestimated. The authors explore the sources of this discrepancy and discuss the implications for managing products in the growing environment of product networks.

348,"This article takes a portfolio approach to examine how an alliance's propensity of termination is influenced by its resource relationships with other alliances of the firm. Whereas previous research has suggested that similar partner resources in a portfolio create redundancy and that dissimilar resources are beneficial, this study argues that redundancy may be necessary to ensure stable access to resources and that synergies from dissimilar resources may be difficult to realize. Thus, under some conditions, resource dissimilarity may be less supportive of, or even detrimental to, the continuity of an alliance. The author identifies several conditional factors that change the role of resource dissimilarity. While relational connectedness between the focal partner and other partners of the firm is found to strengthen the supporting effect of resource dissimilarity on alliance continuity, vertical connectedness of alliance activities, formation of substituting alliances by the focal partner, and market uncertainty weaken the supporting effect of resource dissimilarity. The findings reveal alliance termination factors beyond dyadic interactions and provide important implications for managing interdependencies within an alliance portfolio to enhance alliance stability.

349,"Companies increasingly involve consumers in the process of developing advertising and other marketing actions. An important question that has not been explored is whether brands benefit from communicating to consumers who had not been involved in the co-creation process that a target ad was developed by a fellow consumer. The authors propose a skepticism–identification model of ad creator influence, which hypothesizes that disclosing to an audience that an ad was created by a consumer triggers two opposing effects: skepticism about the competence of the ad creator and identification with the ad creator. Four studies demonstrate that the effectiveness of disclosing advertising co-creation depends on factors that hinder skepticism and heighten identification with the ad creator. Specifically, attributing the ad to a consumer is shown to increase persuasion when the audience (1) has limited cognitive resources to scrutinize the message, (2) is given background information about the ad creator that enhances source similarity, and (3) has high loyalty toward the brand. The implications of these findings on marketing theory and practice are discussed.

350,"Marketers often offer consumers the option to “supersize” a food purchase intended for immediate consumption. Supersized products may be attractive to consumers from the standpoint of the unit pricing because ordering a larger size of the same product results in a per-unit savings and offers consumers the opportunity to meet their value-based financial goals. In this article, the authors show that such pricing strategies not only lead to greater purchase and consumption but do so by affecting important consumer goals in unrelated domains—namely, by decreasing the importance placed on health goals. Although supersized pricing can have a powerful effect on purchase behavior, providing health cues can prevent the decreased focus on health. In addition, supersized pricing can be used to increase size choice of healthy foods. The authors discuss the study's contributions to theory, particularly for understanding decisions regarding the pursuit of multiple goals and, more specifically, those that lie at the intersection of health and finance. In addition, the results suggest both marketing and public policy implications, including those for the obesity epidemic and frequent use of supersized pricing strategies for unhealthy foods.

351,"Historically, when targeting potential adopters of a new product, firms have tended to focus first on people with disproportional effect on others, often labeled “opinion leaders.” The authors highlight the benefit of targeting customers with high lifetime value (CLV), or “revenue leaders.” The authors argue that targeting revenue leaders can create high value both by accelerating adoption among these customers and because of the higher-than-average value that revenue leaders generate by affecting other customers with similarly high CLV. The latter phenomenon is driven by network assortativity, whereby people's social networks tend to be composed of others who are similar to themselves. Analyzing an agent-based model of a seeding program for a new product, the authors contrast revenue leader seeding with opinion leader seeding and compare the factors that influence the effectiveness of each. They show that the distribution of CLV in the population and the seed size play a major role in determining which seeding approach is preferable, and they discuss the managerial implications of these findings.

352,"The brand relationship literature shows that the humanizing of brands and products generates more favorable consumer attitudes and thus enhances brand performance. However, the authors propose negative downstream consequences of brand humanization; that is, the anthropomorphization of a brand can negatively affect consumers’ brand evaluations when the brand faces negative publicity caused by product wrongdoings. They find that consumers who believe in personality stability (i.e., entity theorists) view anthropomorphized brands that undergo negative publicity less favorably than nonanthropomorphized brands. In contrast, consumers who advocate personality malleability (i.e., incremental theorists) are less likely to devalue an anthropomorphized brand from a single instance of negative publicity. Finally, the authors explore three firm response strategies (i.e., denial, apology, and compensation) that can affect the evaluations of anthropomorphized brands for consumers with different implicit theory perspectives. They find that entity theorists have more difficulty in combating the adverse effects of brand anthropomorphization than incremental theorists. Furthermore, they demonstrate that compensation (vs. denial or apology) is the only effective response among entity theorists.

353,"This study examines how household members’ personal characteristics and key marketing factors affect the healthfulness of food purchased for in-home consumption; it further considers how food intake changes following a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes in the household. Using a combination of grocery purchases over four years, survey data about health status, and the nutrition content of 13 of the largest packaged food categories, this study shows that households with higher education and nutrition interest consume fewer calories, sugar, and total carbohydrates, whereas those with higher self-control consume more, because they offset their lower intake of “unhealthy” categories (e.g., soft drinks) with higher intake of “healthy” categories (e.g., cereal). The consumption of sugar and carbohydrates decreases significantly in response to a diabetes diagnosis, whereas the intake of fat and sodium increases. Education, nutrition interest, and self-control are not associated with healthier changes in response to a diagnosis, but younger and higher-income households, as well as those in which the diabetes patient is female, make healthier changes. These findings have notable implications for marketers, consumers, consumer researchers, and public health professionals.

354,"Each year, people in the United States donate more than $200 billion to charitable causes. Despite the lack of understanding of whether and how recognition increases charitable behavior, charities often offer it to motivate donor action. This research focuses on how the effectiveness of recognition on charitable behavior is dependent on the joint influence of two distinct dimensions of moral identity: internalization and symbolization. Three studies examining both monetary donations and volunteering behavior show that recognition increases charitable behavior among those characterized by high moral identity symbolization and low moral identity internalization. Notably, those who show high levels of moral identity internalization are uninfluenced by recognition, regardless of their symbolization. By understanding correlates of the two dimensions of moral identity among donors, nonprofits can strategically recognize potential donors to maximize donation and volunteering behavior.

355,"Although ethnography has become a popular research approach in many organizations, major gaps exist in the field's understanding of the way it operates in the corporate world, particularly in how ethnography facilitates market learning. Drawing from extensive fieldwork in the world of commercial ethnography, the authors describe how ethnographic stories give executives a unique means of understanding market realities. By working through the rich details of ethnographic stories infused with the tensions, contradictions, and emotions of people's everyday lives, executives are better able to grasp the complexity of consumer cultures. Overall, this research should help managers leverage the catalytic effects of ethnographic storytelling in their efforts to learn about and understand market contexts.

356,"Customer referral programs are an effective means of customer acquisition. By assessing a large-scale customer data set from a global cellular telecommunications provider, the authors show that participation in a referral program also increases existing customers’ loyalty. In a field experiment, recommenders’ defection rates fell from 19% to 7% within a year, and their average monthly revenue grew by 11.4% compared with a matched control group. A negative interaction between referral program participation and customer tenure reveals that the loyalty effect of voicing a recommendation is particularly pronounced for newer customer–firm relationships. A laboratory experiment further demonstrates that referral programs with larger rewards strengthen attitudinal and behavioral loyalty, whereas smaller rewards affect only the behavioral dimension. This article contributes to our theoretical understanding of the roles played by the commitment–consistency principle and positive reinforcement theory as mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of customer referral programs.

357,"Prior research suggests that partially comparative pricing—in which a retailer provides price comparisons for some, but not all, of its products—is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, such pricing improves beliefs about the retailer's competitive price advantage on comparatively priced products for which its prices are compared with a competitor. On the other hand, it has been shown to damage perceptions of the retailer's noncomparatively priced products relative to those charged by the competition. However, this latter outcome is based on evidence examining the influence of partially comparative pricing across different product categories. The authors propose and demonstrate in five studies that price comparisons may actually improve relative price beliefs about the noncomparatively priced brands within the same product category. They further show this improvement to be attenuated as the number of price comparisons increase or when the price comparison is attached to a brand perceived as less typical of the product category. The authors conclude by drawing managerial implications and offer suggestions for further research.

358,"How exactly does the display location of a sale price relative to the original price affect consumers’ evaluations? Across multiple studies, including field studies with actual choices and studies with nonstudent samples, this article shows that consumer evaluations are a function of the display location of the sale price, but such evaluations are moderated by discount depth. First, presenting the smaller number to the right (vs. left) makes it easier to initiate the subtraction task, a phenomenon the authors refer to as the “subtraction principle.” Second, given that evaluating sale prices inherently involves a subtraction task, locating sale prices to the right (vs. left) of the original price facilitates calculation of discount depth, increasing evaluations for moderate discounts but not for low discounts. These effects are potentially reversed in cases of both very low discounts and exaggerated discounts. The findings in this article offer novel and nonintuitive insights into how sale price display locations and discount depth interact to influence numerical cognitions, processing of sale prices, and subsequent evaluations.

359,"How does the monetary value of customer purchases vary by customer preference for purchase channels (e.g., traditional, electronic, multichannel) and product category? The authors develop a conceptual model and hypotheses on the moderating effects of two key product category characteristics—the utilitarian versus hedonic nature of the product category and perceived risk—on the channel preference–monetary value relationship. They test the hypotheses on a unique large-scale, empirically generalizable data set in the retailing context. Contrary to conventional wisdom that all multichannel customers are more valuable than single-channel customers, the results show that multichannel customers are the most valuable segment only for hedonic product categories. The findings reveal that traditional channel customers of low-risk categories provide higher monetary value than other customers. Moreover, for utilitarian product categories perceived as high (low) risk, web-only (catalog- or store-only) shoppers constitute the most valuable segment. The findings offer managers guidelines for targeting and migrating different types of customers for different product categories through different channels.

360,"The authors show how new realities in the private-label (PL) landscape, including differential PL-sourcing relationships and differentiated, three-tiered PL portfolios, affect the gross margins that retailers realize on their PLs. In addition, they examine the moderating role of the identity of the PL supplier (dual brander vs. dedicated supplier). Retailer PL margins are lower for stockkeeping units from PL suppliers with whom the retailer shares a more intense relationship, as reflected in their relationship breadth and depth, but this negative effect can be countered through multisourcing. Building prolonged relationships with PL suppliers also results in lower retailer PL margins, but only for more national brand–oriented suppliers. Dedicated PL suppliers have little to gain by building long-term retailer relationships, but they are less vulnerable to the retailer's practice of multisourcing than dual branders. Although economy PLs may appeal to conventional supermarkets to keep (hard) discounters at bay, they result in lower margins (percentage-wise and absolute) than the standard PLs they cannibalize. Premium PLs, in turn, offer the retailer a higher margin, but only when produced by suppliers with a sufficient extent of national brand focus. However, the higher promotional support often given to premium PLs tends to mitigate the actual margin advantage.

361,"Transparent packages are pervasive in food consumption environments. Yet prior research has not systematically examined whether and how transparent packaging affects food consumption. The authors propose that transparent packaging has two opposing effects on food consumption: it enhances food salience, which increases consumption (salience effect), and it facilitates consumption monitoring, which decreases consumption (monitoring effect). They argue that the net effect of transparent packaging on food consumption is moderated by food characteristics (e.g., unit size, appearance). For small, visually attractive foods, the monitoring effect is low, so the salience effect dominates, and people eat more from a transparent package than from an opaque package. For large foods, the monitoring effect dominates the salience effect, decreasing consumption. For vegetables, which are primarily consumed for their health benefits, consumption monitoring is not activated, so the salience effect dominates, which ironically decreases consumption. The authors’ findings suggest that marketers should offer small foods in transparent packages and large foods and vegetables in opaque packages to increase postpurchase consumption (and sales).

362,"The current research explores how shelf display organization and limited product quantity together influence consumer purchase. The authors find that, in certain cases, shelves that are disorganized and not fully stocked tend to reduce sales, but in other cases, disorganized shelves that are not fully stocked tend to increase sales. In particular, for products that are ingested (e.g., juice), purchase likelihood is reduced when the product appears to be disorganized and product quantity is limited. However, for products that are not ingested (e.g., fabric softener), purchase likelihood increases when the product appears to be disorganized and product quantity is limited. Importantly, the authors also show that brand familiarity moderates these effects.

363,"Market share and customer satisfaction are often used to assess marketing performance. Despite the widespread assumption of a positive relationship between these two variables, the limited extant empirical literature on the subject indicates either a negative or a nonsignificant relationship. The authors reexamine this relationship over a longer time period than has previously been possible in a representative sample of U.S. consumer markets and find a consistently significant negative market share–customer satisfaction relationship. This is because customer satisfaction is generally not predictive of firms' future market share, but market share is a strong negative predictor of firms' future customer satisfaction. In follow-up analyses, the authors find that a firm's customer satisfaction can predict its future market share when it is benchmarked against that of its nearest rival and customer switching costs are low. In examining why the market share–future customer satisfaction relationship is generally negative, they find strong support for preference heterogeneity as a key mediator in this relationship. They also show that marketing more brands moderates the negative effect of preference heterogeneity on future customer satisfaction. Thus, larger brand portfolios offer a strategy solution for the general market share–satisfaction trade-off.

364,"Not all repeat purchases are created equal. They can be driven by both positive reaction toward a brand (i.e., attitudinal loyalty) and automaticity triggered by non-brand-related contextual cues (i.e., habit). Combining the loyalty literature with recent habit research, the authors suggest ways to distinguish the two drivers of repeat purchase and examine how they affect consumer response to cross-selling promotions. In Study 1, the authors propose a method to derive individual-level habit strength from consumer transaction records and demonstrate the influence of both attitudinal loyalty and habit on repeat purchase. Studies 2a and 2b then show that attitudinal loyalty facilitates cross-selling, whereas habit has the opposite effect. Finally, in Study 3, the authors suggest a specific promotional design that works better for habitual consumers than for those with attitudinal loyalty and demonstrate that ignoring these two underlying drivers can lead to unintended negative consequences on consumer behavior. This research adds to a richer understanding of repatronage and yields important managerial insights into more effective cross-selling to repeat customers.

365,"Salespeople represent a primary source of competitive intelligence (CI), but the contextual factors that influence the performance impact of salesperson CI quality remain underresearched. The authors develop a framework to examine the performance impact of CI quality at the individual salesperson and sales district levels, with sales district CI quality diversity and sales managers' network centrality as contingencies thereof. The empirical results from multilevel data sets of two U.S.-based corporations reveal that district CI quality diversity weakens the positive performance effect of CI quality at both levels. Sales managers' centrality in within-district and peer advice networks buffers the performance losses created by district CI quality diversity, but salespeople's centrality does not have this buffering effect. The study uncovers conditions under which the positive performance impact of salesperson and district CI quality can disappear and even become negative, thus highlighting the role of managers as CI hubs.

366,"Firms raise a significant amount of funds and gain competitive advantage over their rivals through equity financing, namely through initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings. The authors find that both initial public offering firms and seasoned equity offering firms adopt a more aggressive marketing strategy during the two years following their offering. However, not all equity issuers benefit equally from increased marketing spending, which can help signal companies' growth prospects to investors. A key moderator of the link between marketing investment and firm value is the strategic flexibility of rivals with respect to issuers. In particular, the stock market reacts favorably to an aggressive marketing strategy initiated by issuers competing against rivals with relatively less flexibility, whereas increased marketing expenditures do not translate into higher firm value when rivals have greater flexibility. Furthermore, the authors show that marketing expenditures create value within context: the role of marketing in enhancing shareholder value and the moderating effect of rivals' strategic flexibility are more pronounced in the two-year window immediately following an equity offering than at any other time. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for theory and practice.

367,"An emerging literature stream posits that drawing on users rather than internal designers in new product creation may benefit firms because the resulting products effectively satisfy consumer needs. Four studies conducted in the context of the luxury fashion industry uncover an important conceptual boundary condition of this positive user-design effect. Contrary to extant research, the results show that being “close” to users does not help but rather harms luxury fashion brands. Specifically, the authors find that user design backfires because consumer demand for a given luxury fashion brand collection is reduced if the collection is labeled as user (vs. company) designed. The results further reveal the underlying rationale for this reversal: user-designed luxury products are perceived to be lower in quality and fail to signal high status, which results in a loss of agentic feelings for the consumer. The authors explore several strategies luxury brands can pursue to overcome this negative user-design effect. Finally, they find that negative outcomes of user design are attenuated for luxury fashion products that are not used for status signaling—that is, product categories of a luxury brand that are characterized by lower status relevance for the consumer.

368,"Extant research on product design has suggested that a design's typicality is an important determinant of consumers' aesthetic liking. Yet most studies to date have measured consumers' reactions to designs of varied typicality after a single exposure. In reality, however, consumers usually have multiple opportunities to observe a product before making a decision. Against this background, the authors perform three studies in the automobile domain that examine whether the positive effect of design typicality is moderated by the level of exposure. Study 1 indicates that aesthetic liking of typical car designs is greater at lower exposure levels, whereas people like atypical car designs better at higher exposure levels. Study 2 uses real sales data and indicates that the interaction between design typicality and exposure also affects sales, suggesting that atypical cars may be more successful in the long run. Using experimental manipulations of the key constructs, Study 3 provides evidence for the underlying process and finds renewed support for the notion that design typicality and exposure interact to affect aesthetic liking.

369,"In brand licensing, the brand owner (the licensor) grants another firm (the licensee) the right to use the brand. This differs from franchising, in which a contractual arrangement between a franchisor and a franchisee exists to run a business based on the franchisor's business model. Brand licensing helps generate revenues and protect the brand from misappropriation. In such contractual arrangements, agency theory suggests that when parties to the contract engage in moral hazard (i.e., opportunistic behavior), suboptimal outcomes may result. The authors examine how concerns of moral hazard affect royalty rate, a popular form of compensation in brand licensing. From an agency theory perspective, they discuss how market and contract characteristics influence the risk of moral hazard and shape royalty rates in international brand licensing. The results obtained using data from international licensing contracts indicate that a country's intellectual property rights protection enables licensees to benefit from lower royalty rates and market size enables licensors to demand higher royalty rates. The authors also examine impact of other contract characteristics, such as contract duration and exclusivity, on royalty rate. The results imply that concerns of opportunistic behavior on the part of both the licensor and the licensee influence royalty rates.

370,"With rising public concerns about waste and overconsumption, predicting and effectively managing consumers' package size impressions have become critical for both marketers and public health advocates. The AddChange heuristic model of size impression assumes that people add (rather than multiply) the percentage changes in the height, width, and length of objects to compute their volume. This simple deterministic model does not require any data to accurately predict consumers' perceptions of product downsizing and supersizing when one, two, or all three dimensions change proportionately. It also explains why consumers perceive size reductions accurately when only one dimension of the package is reduced but completely fail to notice up to a 24% downsizing when the product is elongated in the manner specified by the model, even when they pay close attention or weigh the product by hand. The model can be used to determine the dimensions of packages that create accurate size perceptions or that increase consumers' acceptance of downsizing.

371,"Recent managerial evidence and academic research has suggested that consumer decisions are influenced not only by the prices of individual items but also by a retailer's price image, which reflects a consumer's impression of the overall price level of a retailer. Despite the increasing importance of price image in marketing theory and practice, existing research has not provided a clear picture of how price images are formed and how they influence consumer behavior. This article addresses this discrepancy by offering a comprehensive framework delineating the key drivers of price image formation and their consequences for consumer behavior. Contrary to conventional wisdom that assumes price image is mainly a function of a retailer's average price level, this research identifies several price-related and nonprice factors that contribute to price image formation. The authors further identify conditions in which these factors can overcome the impact of the average level of prices, resulting in a low price image despite the retailer's relatively high prices, as well as conditions in which people perceive a retailer to have a high price image despite its relatively low average price level.

372,"Although interest in smart shopping carts is increasing, both retailers and consumer groups have concerns about how real-time spending feedback will influence shopping behavior. Building on budgeting and spending theories, the authors conduct three lab and grocery store experiments that robustly show that real-time spending feedback has a diverging impact on spending depending on whether a person is budget constrained (“budget” shoppers) or not (“nonbudget” shoppers). Real-time spending feedback stimulates budget shoppers to spend more (by buying more national brands). In contrast, this feedback leads nonbudget shoppers to spend less (by replacing national brands with store brands). Furthermore, smart shopping carts increase repatronage intentions for budget shoppers while keeping them stable for nonbudget shoppers. These findings underscore fundamental unexplored differences between budget and nonbudget shoppers. Moreover, they have key implications for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers as well as app developers.

373,"Research has shown brand equity to moderate the relationship between online customer reviews (OCRs) and sales in both the emerging Blu-ray and mature DVD player categories. Positive (negative) OCRs increase (decrease) the sales of models of weak brands (i.e., brands without significant positive brand equity). In contrast, OCRs have no significant impact on the sales of the models of strong brands, although these models do receive a significant sales boost from their greater brand equity. Higher sales lead to a larger number of positive OCRs, and increased positive OCRs aid a brand's transition from weak to strong. This creates a positive feedback loop between sales and positive OCRs for models of weak brands that not only helps their sales but also increases overall brand equity, benefiting all models of the brand. In contrast to the view that brands matter less in the presence of OCRs, we find that OCRs matter less in the presence of strong brands. Positive OCRs function differently than marketing communications in that their effect is greater for weak brands.

374,"Despite the high relevance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in current business practice and the considerable research on CSR outcomes in consumer markets, investigations of its influence on organizational business relationships are scarce. Relying on instrumental stakeholder theory, the authors develop and empirically test a framework of the influence of a supplier's CSR engagement on organizational customer outcomes. Findings from an examination of 200 cross-industry supplier–customer dyads reveal positive effects of two facets of a supplier's CSR efforts on customer loyalty through distinct mechanisms. Business practice CSR fosters customers' trust, whereas philanthropic CSR strengthens customer–company identification. The authors distinguish a supplier's actual CSR engagement and customers' perception of these CSR activities. In addition, they consider central contingency factors reflecting uncertainty and dependence in business-to-business relationships that determine the effectiveness of CSR.

375,"This article examines how firms in interorganizational relationships respond differently to active and passive opportunism and observes how these opportunism forms erode satisfaction with the performance of these relationships. The multimethod approach of two experiments and one longitudinal field study demonstrate that firms tolerate more passive opportunism than active opportunism (Study 1) and that transaction costs play a mediating role between opportunism form and satisfaction with performance of the relationship (Study 2). Finally, the field study reveals that, over time, passive opportunism has a more corrosive impact on satisfaction with performance than active opportunism (Study 3). Together, the findings underscore the importance of distinguishing passive and active opportunism and the need to develop a better understanding of its management and consequences.

376,"Competing suppliers that collaborate to serve downstream original equipment manufacturer customers often encounter partners with overlapping and compatible knowledge bases. Such knowledge base compatibility provides supplier partners the opportunity to exchange knowledge efficiently, leading to greater knowledge sharing. However, the ease of misappropriation of the shared knowledge can offset this beneficial effect. This research proposes that the effect of knowledge base compatibility on supplier partners' knowledge sharing is moderated by the customer's participation in the collaborative effort and by the customer value such effort creates. The results of two empirical studies show that when levels of both customer participation and customer value are high, knowledge base compatibility between supplier partners leads to greater knowledge sharing. In contrast, when customer participation is high but customer value is low, knowledge base compatibility leads to lower levels of supplier knowledge sharing. This investigation validates the importance of key factors related to supplier partners' opportunity and motivation to share knowledge in coopetitive partnerships.

377,"This research examines how branded service encounters, in which frontline service employee behavior is aligned with a firm's brand positioning, may positively affect customer responses to brands. Across two brand personality contexts, Study 1 demonstrates that employee–brand alignment increases overall brand evaluations and customer-based brand equity, with more pronounced results for unfamiliar brands. Study 2 shows that conceptual fluency underlies the effect of employee–brand alignment on overall brand evaluations for unfamiliar brands. Study 3 reveals that employee authenticity enhances the effectiveness of employee–brand alignment. Finally, a critical incident study (Study 4) extends the generalizability of these findings to a wider variety of service contexts. This research is the first to demonstrate how firms can leverage employee behavior as a brand-building advantage, particularly for new or unfamiliar brands as they establish their positioning with customers.

378,"Images of food are seemingly everywhere, and yet the influence that such images have on important consumer outcomes is not well understood. The authors propose that the effect that image exposure has on taste perceptions largely depends on the interaction between the type of food (healthy vs. unhealthy) and whether the image shows the food alone (food image) or the food being consumed by a person (consummatory image). Specifically, the authors show that exposure to consummatory images of unhealthy (vs. healthy) foods increases taste perceptions relative to food images. To explain this effect, the authors argue that seeing an image of someone else indulging in an unhealthy food serves as social proof of the appropriateness and acceptability of indulgent consumption. As such, images of consumers eating act as a justification agent for real consumers, thereby reducing the conflict associated with the subsequent indulgent consumption experience and, in effect, increasing taste perceptions. The authors test this effect across five studies and eliminate rival explanations pertaining to emotional contagion, goal contagion, and source attractiveness.

379,"The success of products such as FarmVille has prompted many firms to engage in viral marketing on Facebook and other social media websites. Yet is the viral marketing approach adopted for games suitable for other, more utilitarian products? This study aims to answer questions that link product characteristics and contexts to viral marketing success: Should primarily utilitarian products rely on the same sharing mechanisms for their viral marketing campaigns as less utilitarian products? If not, why is this the case, and how should viral marketing for primarily utilitarian products differ? This empirical study analyzes the Facebook viral marketing campaigns of 751 products and reveals that the same sharing mechanism that made FarmVille so successful is the worst possible mechanism for promoting primarily utilitarian products. These findings are in line with theory from social psychology: because consumers do not visit Facebook to learn about utilitarian products, they rely on simple cues and heuristics to process viral marketing messages about these products. This study thus contributes to literature on viral marketing in general and sharing mechanisms in particular; it also offers practical, hands-on recommendations to marketing managers in charge of designing viral marketing campaigns for both more and less utilitarian products.

380,"Although an extensive body of research has emerged on marketing in computer-mediated environments, the literature remains fragmented. As a result, insights and findings have accumulated without an overarching framework to provide structure and guidance to the rapidly increasing research stream, which is detrimental to long-term knowledge development in this area. To address this issue, the authors organize and synthesize findings from the literature using a framework structured around four key interactions in computer-mediated environments: consumer–firm interactions, firm–consumer interactions, consumer–consumer interactions, and firm–firm interactions. The proposed framework serves a valuable organizational function and helps identify a broad spectrum of gaps in the literature to advance the next generation of knowledge development.

381,"Service delivery often involves a series of events or stages of exchange between a service provider and its customer. At each stage, performance can meet, exceed, or fall below the customer's expectations. This article contributes to the literature by examining how the patterns of distribution (frequency, timing, proximity, and sequence) of service failures and delights affect customers’ perceptions of service quality. The authors propose a conceptual model based on mental accounting principles derived from prospect theory and develop a series of research propositions to explicate the links between distribution patterns of service failures/delights and service quality perceptions. The study integrates prospect theory with service encounter research and provides a comprehensive theory-driven platform for exploring the impact of various service failure and delight distribution patterns. In addition, it offers important managerial implications for service design and resource allocation regarding when, how often, how close, and in what order delights and failures should take place to maximize gains from delights and minimize losses from failures.

382,"The Internet is dominated by free web services that depend on advertising revenues and powerful marketing tools to support their business models. Targeted online advertising enables websites to increase their advertising revenues by selectively displaying advertisements according to users’ browsing behavior, sociodemographics, and interests. Yet targeting also creates negative consumer reactions, and websites confront increasing regulatory pressures to inform consumers about their practices. It is critical for such advertising-supported websites to address those challenges proactively. In one scenario experiment and two field studies, the authors show that a normative reciprocity argument is generally more effective than the current industry practice of using a utilitarian argument related to advertising relevance to increase acceptance of targeted online advertising. However, in some cases, this dominance switches depending on specific website characteristics such as website utility and level of user-generated content. Managers of free websites should remind their users of the free services they enjoy when asking permission to target them online or to use their personal information.

383,"This article integrates relationship marketing and social network perspectives to develop and test a model that links objective sales performance with the informational and cooperative benefits that stem from relationship managers’ (RMs') social capital structure (brokerage and density) and relations (formal and informal networks). The authors demonstrate the effect of cross-network and overlap-network synergies on performance. Data about both formal and informal networks of 464 employees, including 101 RMs, demonstrate that RMs’ performance improves with cross-network synergy when informational benefits from wide-reaching, nonoverlapping ties in the informal network combine with the cooperative benefits of a densely interconnected formal network. In addition, the effects of formal and informal social capital structure on performance increase significantly when RMs have a high degree of network overlap between their formal and informal networks.

384,"This article investigates the sales force socialization process, wherein newly hired salespeople often face failure-prone environments. Drawing from the learned helplessness paradigm, the authors hypothesize that cumulative periods of sales performance failure are associated with sales-oriented behavior intentions. In addition, the authors examine the influence of leadership, expecting core transformational leadership to have a diminishing effect as unmet sales goals accumulate. Study 1 finds support for these hypotheses using panel survey data from 221 new hires during six months of a furniture retailer's sales force socialization process. Then, aiming to uncover the underlying mechanism driving salesperson helplessness and a managerial approach that has a sustained impact, the authors conduct Study 2, a scenario-based experiment focused on the business-to-business insurance industry. The authors find that perceived task difficulty mediates the focal relationship and that error management enables core transformational leadership to have a lasting effect such that new hires have the lowest sales-oriented behavior intentions when transformational sales managers encourage them to make errors during their interactions with customers and to actively learn from their failures.

385,"Marketers are increasingly allowing consumers to sample sensory-rich experiential products before making purchase decisions. The results of seven experimental studies (two conducted in field settings, three conducted in a laboratory, and two conducted online) demonstrate that the order in which consumers sample products and the level of (dis)similarity between the sensory cues of the products influence choices. In the absence of any moderators, when sampling a sequence of sensory-rich experiential products (e.g., fragrances, chocolates, flavored beverages, music) with similar sensory cues (e.g., smell, taste, color, sound), consumers prefer the first product in the sequence. However, when sampling a sequence of products with dissimilar sensory cues, consumers prefer the last product. These findings (1) contribute to a better understanding of the role of sequential sensory cues on consumer choice formation, (2) have implications for effects related to sensory habituation and sensory trace fading, and (3) help resolve apparent inconsistencies in prior research on order effects in the context of choices for sequentially sampled experiential products.

386,"How many positive claims should firms use to produce the most positive impression of a product or service? This article posits that when consumers know that the message source has a persuasion motive, the optimal number of positive claims is three. Increasing the number of claims improves consumer perceptions until the fourth claim, at which point consumers’ persuasion knowledge causes them to view all the claims with skepticism. The studies herein establish and explore this pattern, which the authors refer to as the “charm of three.” An initial experiment indicates that impressions peak at three claims for sources with a persuasion motive but not for sources without a persuasion motive. The second experiment indicates that this effect occurs for attitudes and impressions and that increased skepticism at four or more claims explains the effect. Two final experiments examine the mental process by which the charm of three occurs by investigating how cognitive load and sequential claims influence the effect.

387,"Customer prioritization strategies, which focus a firm's efforts on its most important customers, are expected to improve account profitability. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that such strategies may also undermine account profitability by inducing customers to become overly demanding. Building on social exchange theory, this research evaluates these competing perspectives across two field studies and finds that prioritization is best understood as a double-edged sword. Specifically, the results reveal that prioritization efforts initiate both a gratitude-driven process, which enhances sales and profit, and an entitlement-driven process, which increases service costs and reduces profit. Importantly, the findings indicate that prioritization tactics differ in the extent to which they trigger these competing processes and thus in their ability to influence account profitability. Finally, the results also reveal that critical moderators (competitive intensity and prioritization transparency) determine the extent to which the entitlement-driven process undermines the gratitude-driven process. For managers, the findings suggest that both the tactics employed and moderating conditions determine whether prioritization has a positive, negative, or negligible effect on prioritized accounts’ profitability.

388,"Group-buying (GB) deals entail a two-phase decision process. First, consumers decide whether to buy a deal. Second, they decide when to redeem the deal, conditional on purchase. Guided by theories of social influence and observational learning, the authors develop a framework predicting that (1) deal popularity increases consumers’ purchase likelihood and decreases redemption time, conditional on purchase, and (2) the social influence–related factors of referral intensity and group consumption amplify these effects. The authors test this framework and support it using a unique data set of 30,272 customers of a GB website with several million data points. Substantially, these findings reveal a two-phase perspective of GB, longevity effects of deal popularity, and the amplifying role of customer referrals (influencing others) in the effects of deal popularity (others’ influence). In light of the criticism of GB industry practice, this study builds the case for GB websites and merchants to heed deal popularity information and the social influence–related contingencies.

389,"In business-to-business markets, suppliers often ask an existing customer to provide a referral for them (i.e., a supplier-selected referral), in which the supplier selects a referrer to influence a specific potential customer favorably. The selection of the referrer is important because the right referrer providing the right message can generate business for the supplier. To study supplier-selected referrals, the authors extend the dyadic source–message–recipient communication framework to propose a framework that incorporates the supplier and the supplier's management of the communication between the referrer and the potential customer. They label this framework the Managed Triadic Communication (MaTriC) framework. The authors conduct three experimental studies in which they apply the MaTriC framework to the domain of supplier-selected referrals and focus on the contingent role of supplier uncertainty. The authors find that the benefits of a supplier-selected referral are contingent on supplier uncertainty. For example, their findings imply that an outsupplier should focus on selecting a referrer that would give an all-positive evaluation (vs. a balanced evaluation), whereas an insupplier should focus on selecting a highly credible referrer, even if that referral does not provide an all-positive evaluation of the supplier.

390,"Many firms capitalize on their customers’ social networks to improve the success rate of their new products. In this article, the authors analyze the dynamic effects of social influence and direct marketing on the adoption of a new high-technology product. Social influence is likely to play a role because the decision to adopt a high-involvement product requires extensive information gathering from various sources. The authors use call detail records to construct ego networks for a large sample of customers of a Dutch mobile telecommunications operator. Using a fractional polynomial hazard approach to model adoption timing and multiple social influence variables, they provide a fine-grained analysis of social influence. They show that the effect of social influence from cumulative adoptions in a customer's network decreases from the product introduction onward, whereas the influence of recent adoptions remains constant. The effect of direct marketing is also positive and decreases from the product introduction onward. This study provides new insights into the adoption of high-technology products by analyzing dynamic effects of social influence and direct marketing simultaneously.

391,"A key benefit of private labels for retailers is their potential to increase customers’ store loyalty. However, previous research has not examined how this relationship varies across customers and situations. This study contributes to knowledge in this area by developing a conceptual framework that guides the investigation of the role of four moderating factors in strengthening the private label brand share–store loyalty link: (1) customers’ price-oriented behavior, (2) degree of commoditization of the product category, (3) product category involvement, and (4) the retailer's price positioning. This article draws on a large-scale empirical study using a household panel and questionnaire data for 35 diverse fast-moving consumer goods product categories. The results of this study show that the relationship between private label share and store loyalty is more complex than previous research has suggested. Specifically, the private label brand share–store loyalty link is stronger for customers with high price-oriented behavior, retailers with a low price positioning, and product categories that are less commoditized and have relatively higher involvement.

392,"Manufacturers or resellers introducing a new product often must decide whether and for how long to be its exclusive seller. Standard models of competition and conventional wisdom suggest that exclusivity boosts profits. However, using both agent-based simulations and game-theoretic modeling, the authors find that positive word of mouth (WOM) from customers of rival firms can make exclusivity unprofitable. This reversal of conventional wisdom occurs because WOM creates a positive externality, and a firm holding exclusivity cannot benefit from the WOM spillover generated by customers of other firms. The benefits of forgoing exclusivity are magnified by (1) the presence of locked-in customers who consider buying from only a single firm, (2) the extent to which opinion leaders are among a firm's own locked-in customers rather than those of competitors, and (3) customers’ low price sensitivity. In addition, firms sometimes benefit from forgoing exclusivity even without WOM from rivals’ customers, but only when the combination of large-scale lock-in, high price sensitivity, and strong WOM among the firm's customers exists.

393,"In five studies, the authors examine the impact of an independent (vs. interdependent) mindset on consumer adoption of new products. Study 1 demonstrates that consumers in a predominantly independent (vs. interdependent) culture are more willing to adopt really new products, whereas consumers in a predominantly interdependent (vs. independent) culture are more willing to adopt incrementally new products. Studies 2 and 3 conceptually replicate these findings using situationally activated mindsets and demonstrate that this effect is driven by the perceived fit between the product's newness level and the optimal level of distinctiveness consumers want. Finally, Studies 4a and 4b show that the presence of distinctiveness-dampening cues (i.e., popularity cues) and distinctiveness-enhancing cues (i.e., scarcity cues) can reverse the effect of self-perspective such that the independent self becomes less willing to adopt really new products and more willing to adopt incrementally new products than does the interdependent self. These findings offer practical implications for managing innovation adoption in both domestic and international marketplaces.
","We examine the impact of consumer choice on the emergence of new products and services. We find that consumers' choice of new products and services is positively related to the level of consumer satisfaction with the new product or service. However, the effect of consumer choice on the emergence of new products and services is not fully explained by the level of consumer satisfaction with the new product or service. We find that consumers' choice of new products and services is positively related to the level of consumer satisfaction with the new product or service. We also find that consumers' choice of new products and services is positively related to the level of consumer satisfaction with the new product or service. We also find that consumers' choice of new products and services is positively related to the level of consumer satisfaction with the new product or service.

394,"Although there is increased awareness of issues surrounding consumer well-being, consumers often lack the personal commitment to improve their quality of life. This article builds on the concept of a goal hierarchy to propose that small acts may have unintended, large consequences on various domains of consumer well-being. A decrease in commitment to well-being goals (e.g., sustaining the natural environment) may stem from people's failure to achieve everyday subgoals (e.g., failing to recycle a newspaper). Four experiments in three contexts (i.e., consumer overspending, environmentally friendly behaviors, and charitable donations) show that when people perceive the endgoal as unimportant, even a single behavioral failure may reduce commitment to a well-being endgoal and weaken future intentions to perform behaviors that improve their quality of life. In addition, goal importance moderates the adverse relationship between subgoal performance and endgoal commitment. The authors present consumer-specific and marketer-controlled drivers of goal importance (i.e., goal visualization, self-relevance of goals, and aversive consequences of subgoal failure) and discuss actionable insights for practitioners.

395,"Although cross-selling offers significant benefits for both vendors and customers, three-quarters of all cross-selling initiatives fail, typically for sales force–related reasons. Prior research examining the antecedents of salespeople's product adoption has not yet shown whether or under which conditions such adoption behavior leads to better salesperson cross-selling performance. The authors develop a model of the role of supervisory behavior, compensation-based controls, and their interactions in enhancing the effect of salespeople's adoption behavior on cross-selling performance in a complex selling context. To test the model, the authors use a matched, multilevel data set from company records and surveys of salespeople and sales managers working in a biotech firm. The analysis shows that transformational leadership enhances the effect of salespeople's product portfolio adoption on cross-selling performance, whereas transactional leadership diminishes the effect. Furthermore, the effect of leadership type depends on whether cross-selling incentives are provided: the positive performance effect of transformational leadership is crowded out when monetary incentives are provided, and the negative effect of transactional leadership becomes even more negative. These results have significant theoretical and managerial implications.

396,"This study examines frontline employee responses to corporate social responsibility (CSR) using a multisourced data set at a Global 500 financial services company. The authors find that frontline employees identify with the organization (i.e., organizational identification) and with customers (i.e., employee–customer identification) as a function of how much the employees perceive management and customers (respectively) to support the company's CSR activities. However, these respective effects are stronger among employees for whom CSR is already tied to their sense of self (i.e., CSR importance to the employee). In addition, both organizational identification and employee–customer identification are related to supervisor-rated job performance; however, only the effect of employee–customer identification is mediated by customer orientation, suggesting that these two targets of identification manifest through distinct mechanisms. The research empirically addresses the open questions of whether and when CSR can yield observable changes in employee behavior and alerts researchers to a novel target of identification for frontline employees.

397,"Although changes to the channel system are among a firm's most critical decisions, prior research has neglected to examine the impact of channel expansions on firm value. This article investigates whether a firm's announcement of an increase in distribution intensity or the establishment of a new channel influences firm value. The authors also consider the moderating role of context-specific firm, market, and channel strategy contingencies. They test their hypotheses with an event study of 240 announcements of major channel expansions in the United States, Germany, and China. The results indicate that channel expansions affect firm value (i.e., through abnormal stock returns). However, the two types of channel expansions affect firm value differently. Whereas the establishment of a new channel positively influences firm value, reactions to an increase in distribution intensity are highly contingent. For example, firms operating in exceedingly turbulent or competitive markets experience firm value reductions in response to an increase in distribution intensity. Notably, the same two environmental contingencies enhance firm value when the firm establishes a new channel.

398,"Although retailers invest millions of dollars in redesigning, refreshing, and remodeling their stores, it is unclear that such large investments are worthwhile. Prior research has indicated that remodeling has only a short-term effect. However, a previously unexplored area is its effect on those who visit the store for the first time after it is remodeled (new customers) versus those who had visited before the remodeling (existing customers). This study contrasts the effect of store remodeling on new and existing customers in two field experiments with stores that underwent a major remodeling. Treatment and control stores are used in both experiments. The authors measure sales before and after the remodeling for new and existing customers; in one store, they also measure customers’ psychological responses. In both cases, sales increased after the remodeling effort. However, sales for new customers are significantly higher than sales for existing customers after the remodel, and this difference persists for a year. Higher sales to new customers are primarily due to more new customers being drawn to the remodeled store, their higher spend per visit, and their subsequent increased visit frequency.
",We study the impact of customer-level changes in online shopping on the purchase of new products. We find that customers who purchase new products at a higher price are more likely to purchase new products at a lower price. We also find that customers who purchase new products at a lower price are more likely to purchase new products at a higher price. We also find that customers who purchase new products at a higher price are more likely to purchase new products at a lower price. We also find that customers who purchase new products at a lower price are more likely to purchase new products at a higher price. We also find that customers who purchase new products at a lower price are more likely to purchase new products at a higher price. We also find that customers who purchase new products at a lower price are more likely to purchase new products at a higher price. We also find that customers who purchase new products at a lower price are more likely to purchase new products at a higher price.

399,"Increasingly, circumstances such as divorce, employment commuting, and military service have resulted in the geographic dispersion of family networks, and this reality holds both risks and opportunities for brands, products, and services embedded in family life. The authors leverage a longitudinal design including group interviews (initial/follow-up) and participant diaries to track how families’ consumption practices shift in response to separation, morphing across time and place to retain and strengthen family bonds. Their findings generate a framework that explains how and when colocated consumption practices reassemble through technologies across distances. The framework considers practice dimensions, separation type, motivation, potential/realized capacities, and mobilized technologies to forecast potential practice trajectories under conditions of extended separation. Five potential trajectories emerge: no trial, heroic quests, failed trial, easy translations, and sacred pieces. The authors’ discussion of managerial implications provides suggestions to enable companies to anticipate trajectories and take action to enhance brand use and loyalty to ensure that their brands survive reassembly within existing family practices or become integral to new family practices that feature the brand.

400,"This research examines how the implicit egotism resulting from consumers’ positive self-associations affects their evaluations of product prices. The effects can occur when the product's price and the consumer share either name-letters (name-letter/price effect) or birthday-numbers (birthday-number/price effect). Through a series of studies, the authors demonstrate that the positive affect linked to name-letters and birthday-numbers transfers directly to consumers’ price predilections and ultimately affects their purchase intentions. More specifically, consumers like prices (e.g., “fifty-five dollars”) that contain digits beginning with the same first letter (e.g., “F”) as their own name (e.g., “Fred,” “Mr. Frank”) more than prices that do not. Similarly, prices that contain cents digits (e.g., $49.15) that correspond to a consumer's date of birth (e.g., April 15) also enhance pricing liking and purchase intentions. Across groups of consumers, the authors’ findings demonstrate that implicit egotism effects can result in greater purchase intentions for a higher-priced product compared with a lower-priced product.
",We examine the impact of a “price-tag” (price-tag) on the purchase of a product.

401,"Although it is well-known that the U.S. population is increasingly culturally diverse, cultural diversity within U.S. households is less recognized. This study investigates the effects of cultural dynamics on decision roles and influence within the binational household. In particular, the authors study households in which one spouse is from the United States and the other is an immigrant. The analysis uses survey data and in-depth interviews. Cultural competence (i.e., knowledge of country of residence) as a source of expert power and as a form of cultural capital in family decision making emerge as overarching themes. The authors also find that one family member may engage in cultural compensatory mechanisms in consumption in response to the immigrant family member's sacrifices (i.e., moving to the United States). The authors close with a discussion of the implications for family decision-making theory, marketers, and society.

402,"Food marketing is facing increasing challenges in using portion size (e.g., “supersizing”) as a marketing tool. Marketers have used portion size to attract customers and encourage purchase, but social agencies are expressing concern that larger portion sizes encourage greater consumption, which can cause excessive consumption and obesity. This article addresses two questions that are central to this debate: (1) How much effect does portion size have on consumption? and (2) Are there limits to this effect? A meta-analytic review reveals that, for a doubling of portion size, consumption increases by 35% on average. However, the effect has limits. An extended analysis shows that the effect of portion size is curvilinear: as portions become increasingly larger, the effect diminishes. In addition, although the portion-size effect is widespread and robust across a range of individual and environmental factors, the analysis shows that it is weaker among children, women, and overweight individuals, as well as for nonsnack food items and in contexts in which more attention is given to the food being eaten.

403,"The authors introduce and examine a new marketing concept that a small set of leading firms has begun to adopt: marketing doctrine. Marketing doctrine refers to a firm's unique principles, distilled from its experiences, which provide firm-wide guidance on market-facing choices. As such, marketing doctrine provides a firm-wide common approach to decision making. Importantly, marketing doctrine helps a firm address the classic consistency–flexibility conundrum by providing high-level guidance to all decision makers in the firm (thus ensuring consistency) but not specifying execution details (thus allowing for local flexibility). Across three samples, the authors explore the concept using a discovery-oriented, theories-in-use approach with 35 executives from several industries. This article makes four contributions. First, it offers a parsimonious definition of the marketing doctrine construct and contrasts it with related constructs. Second, it offers insight into how firms can develop marketing doctrine. Third, it develops a conceptual model that identifies the antecedents and consequences of marketing doctrine use. Finally, the authors explore the moderating effects of three unpredictable environments (competitive intensity, market turbulence, and structural flux) on the marketing doctrine use–performance relationship.

404,"Social tagging is a new way to share and categorize online content that enables users to express their thoughts, perceptions, and feelings with respect to diverse concepts. In social tagging, content is connected through user-generated keywords—“tags”—and is readily searchable through these tags. The rich associative information that social tagging provides marketers new opportunities to infer brand associative networks. This article investigates how the information contained in social tags can act as a proxy measure for brand performance and can predict the financial valuation of a firm. Using data collected from a social tagging and bookmarking website, Delicious, the authors examine social tagging data for 44 firms across 14 markets. After controlling for accounting metrics, media citations, and other user-generated content, they find that social tag–based brand management metrics capturing brand familiarity, favorability of associations, and competitive overlaps of brand associations can explain unanticipated stock returns. In addition, they find that in managing brand equity, it is more important for strong brands to enhance category dominance, whereas it is more critical for weak brands to enhance connectedness. These findings suggest a new way for practitioners to track, measure, and manage intangible brand equity; proactively improve brand performance; and influence a firm's financial performance.

405,"This article aims to specify the performance implications of neutral user-generated content (UGC) on product sales by differentiating mixed-neutral UGC, which contains an equal amount of positive and negative claims, from indifferent-neutral UGC, which includes neither positive nor negative claims. The authors propose that positive and negative UGC only provide opportunities for consumers to process product-related information, whereas both mixed- and indifferent-neutral UGC affect consumers’ motivation and ability to process positive and negative UGC. The results of three studies using multiple measures (text and numerical UGC), contexts (automobiles, movies, and tablets), and methods (empirical and behavioral experiment) indicate contrasting premium and discount effects such that mixed-neutral UGC amplifies the effects of positive and negative UGC, whereas indifferent-neutral UGC attenuates them. Empirical evidence further indicates that ignoring mixed- or indifferent-neutral UGC leads to substantial under- or overestimates of the effects of positive and negative UGC. The effects of neutral UGC on product sales thus are not truly neutral, and the direction of the bias depends on both the type of UGC and the distribution of positive and negative UGC.

406,"Industrial component suppliers (CSs) work to enhance profitability by building brand differentiation with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and indirect industrial buyers (IIBs) through their marketing investments to each member. However, as a CS increases its marketing investments to its IIB, the OEM's profit position is threatened, motivating the OEM to respond with aligning or opposing behavior. The results from a three-study, multimethod design indicate that a CS's strategy of allocating its marketing investments between its OEM and IIB increases its brand differentiation, which allows it to capture increased profits subject to conditions of uncertainty. However, the results also demonstrate that the OEM does not sit idly by as its CS invests in building brand differentiation with the IIB; rather, it reacts with both aligning and opposing behaviors to benefit from the CS's investments as well as offset the CS's gains.

407,"Managers and academics often think of price promotions merely as incentives that entice consumers to accept offers that they might not have considered otherwise. Yet the prospect of paying a lower price for a product of given quality can also discourage deliberation, in a sense “dumbing down” the purchase encounter by making it less consequential. The authors examine this possibility in a dual-system theory of consumer behavior. Specifically, they argue that price promotion lowers a consumer's motivation to exert mental effort, in which case purchase decisions are guided less by extensive information processing and more by a quicker, easier, strong conditioner of preference: affect. Field data from a large daily deal company and four controlled experiments support this idea and document its implications primarily for product choice, in turn providing insight into the form and cause of brand switching that manufacturers and retailers can leverage to improve the allocation of promotional budgets and category management.

408,"The media industry has undergone a fundamental shift over the past decade as new online distribution channels have proliferated in an unprecedented manner. Although mobile devices have experienced rapid adoption among consumers, their effect on consumer behavior and their subsequent implications for publishers and advertisers have yet to be understood. The authors examine consumers’ news consumption behavior on mobile news websites in response to the introduction of a mobile news app. Pseudo-panel analysis based on repeated cross-sectional data suggests that the introduction of a mobile app by a major national media company leads to a significant increase in demand at the corresponding mobile news website. In addition, the authors report that this effect is greater for consumers with (1) greater appreciation for concentrated news content, (2) stronger propensity for a particular political viewpoint, and (3) fewer time constraints. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the adoption of a provider's news app stimulates corresponding mobile news website visits. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for advertisers, media publishers, and policy makers.
",We examine the impact of online advertising on the adoption of mobile devices in the United States. We find that the adoption of mobile devices increases the adoption of mobile-enabled products by approximately 2.5%–3.5% in the first year after adoption. The adoption of mobile-enabled products increases the adoption of mobile-enabled products by approximately 2.5%–3.5% in the second year after adoption. The adoption of mobile-enabled products increases the adoption of mobile-enabled products by approximately 2.5%–3.5% in the third year after adoption. The adoption of mobile-enabled products increases the adoption of mobile-enabled products by approximately 2.5%–3.5% in the fourth year after adoption.

409,"Interpersonal exchanges between customers and frontline service employees increasingly involve the use of technology, such as point-of-sale terminals, tablets, and kiosks. The present research draws on role and script theories to demonstrate that customer reactions to technology-infused service exchanges depend on the presence of employee rapport. When rapport is present during the exchange, the use of technology functions as an interpersonal barrier preventing the customer from responding in kind to employee rapport-building efforts, thereby decreasing service encounter evaluations. However, during service encounters in which employees are not engaging in rapport building, technology functions as an interpersonal barrier, enabling customers to retreat from the relatively unpleasant service interaction, thereby increasing service encounter evaluations. Two analyses using J.D. Power Guest Satisfaction Index data support the barrier and beneficial effects of technology use during service encounters with and without rapport, respectively. A follow-up experiment replicates this data pattern and identifies psychological discomfort as a key process that governs the effect. For managers, the results demonstrate the inherent incompatibility of initiatives designed to encourage employee–customer rapport with those that introduce technology into frontline service exchanges.
","The increasing use of social media platforms to facilitate customer service interactions has led to a growing concern about the effectiveness of social media platforms. In this paper, we investigate the effects of social media platforms on customer service interactions. We conducted a qualitative study of a large-scale customer service service company in which a customer service manager was assigned to a social media platform and a customer service manager was assigned to a social media platform. We found that social media platforms significantly increased customer service interactions, but not the customer service manager’s ability to respond to customer requests. We also found that social media platforms significantly increased customer service interactions, but not the customer service manager’s ability to respond to customer requests. We also found that social media platforms significantly increased customer service interactions, but not the customer service manager’s ability to respond to customer requests. We also found that social media platforms significantly increased customer service interactions, but not the customer service manager’s ability to respond to customer requests. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of social media platforms and the design of social media platforms for customer service.  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \",0.4092903,-0.35721493,-0.5590256,-0.46652052,-0.43592605,-1.3812354,-1.2655777,0.6121499,0.36540812,0.6487533,0.4917801,-0.50655925,-0.32372484,0.098729804,0.87833637,0.39000848,0.45648402,-0.5864545,0.6548224,0.03607427,-1.2004019,0.008573439,-1.5492787,0.7368772,-1.6781002,1.0522127,0.39934954,-0.66672987,-0.30951378,-1.5515064,0.24873511,0.41325295,-1.4725807,-1.3921342,-0.15267166,0.21661834,-0.6303173,-0.19407602,-0.2752639,-0.27156785,-0.94105995,1.3798618,-0.22771113,-0.726928,0.5475752,-0.29858214,-0.38175428,1.4030718,0.61462384,0.26570585,0.95215666,0.6813135,0.51730704,-1.635763,-0.9670947,0.12614198,-0.60165566,0.22757852,-0.45640802,-0.6593009,-0.09818608,1.6297619,-1.2658582,0.28927627,1.3588326,0.57589674,-1.63209,-0.7208041,0.49146277,-0.7165275,0.5562653,0.43487108,0.5517503,-1.0391531,-0.4369548,0.054560747,1.3328335,0.6333819,0.1960585,-0.7563371,-0.088140875,-1.0361806,-0.027474806,0.44653282,0.43626705,1.5943594,0.4838125,-0.6253348,-1.2403053,1.6368427,0.06936738,-0.33186543,1.600658,-1.6582551,0.7108129,-0.8389263,-0.43315348,-0.07146975,0.2591514,0.029321535,0.89574033,-0.86654365,0.4947231,-0.018748596,1.0293149,0.093153946,-0.98842126,-0.42140573,0.5736807,-0.40940616,1.2493219,0.34470803,-0.12959592,0.7111802,-0.13016023,0.06640469,0.34499344,0.6086328,0.88452685,1.2450362,-0.07848599,0.26201817,-0.0035724756,0.2793274,-0.87637407,-0.3891357,0.4564459,-0.7589456
410,"Although the new middle classes in emerging markets are a matter of significant interest for marketing scholars and managers, there has been little systematic research on their values and preoccupations. This article focuses on new middle class consumers to identify the new, shared socio-ideological sensibilities informed by the recent neoliberal reforms in emerging markets and examines how these sensibilities are actualized in consumption. Through an ethnographic study of fashion consumption in Turkey, the authors explicate three salient new middle class sensibilities, which implicate the mastery of the ordinary in pursuit of connections with people, institutions, and contexts. These sensibilities crystallize into a particular mode of consumption—“formulaic creativity”—which addresses consumers’ desire to align with the middle and helps them reconcile the disjuncture between the promises of neoliberalism and the realities of living in unstable societies. The article provides recommendations on product portfolio management, positioning strategies, and marketing mix adaptation decisions.

411,"Internet-based business-to-business platforms involve a buyer side transacting with a seller side, both of which are customers of an intermediary platform firm. Dyadic viewpoints implicit in conventional theories of customer orientation thus must be modified to apply to a triadic relationship system (seller–platform–buyer) in platform settings. The authors propose that customer orientation of platform firms consists of total customer orientation (customer orientation toward both the buyer and seller sides) and customer orientation asymmetry (customer orientation in favor of the seller relative to the buyer side) and examine the antecedents and consequences of these orientations. Data from 109 business-to-business electronic platforms reveal that buyer- (seller-) side concentration increases total customer orientation and customer orientation asymmetry toward sellers (buyers). These positive effects are weaker when buyers and sellers interact directly (two-sided matching) versus indirectly (one-sided matching) and are stronger when the offering prices vary (dynamic price discovery) versus remain stable (static price discovery) during negotiations. Finally, total customer orientation increases platform performance by itself and in interaction with customer concentration, but orientation asymmetry increases performance only in conjunction with customer concentration.

412,"This research investigates how the social elements of a retail store visit affect shoppers’ product interaction and purchase likelihood. The research uses a bivariate model of the shopping process, implemented in a hierarchical Bayes framework, which models the customer and contextual factors driving product touch and purchase simultaneously. A unique video tracking database captures each shopper's path and activities during the store visit. The findings reveal that interactive social influences (e.g., salesperson contact, shopper conversations) tend to slow the shopper down, encourage a longer store visit, and increase product interaction and purchase. When shoppers are part of a larger group, they are influenced more by discussions with companions and less by third parties. Stores with customers present encourage product interaction up to a point, beyond which the density of shoppers interferes with the shopping process. The effects of social influence vary by the salesperson's demographic similarity to the shopper and the type of product category being shopped. Several behavioral cues signal when shoppers are in a potentially high need state and may be good sales prospects.

413,"Although customer complaints are a well-studied aspect of business, no study has measured the impact of actual complaints and recoveries on subsequent customer purchasing. The authors develop a customer base model to investigate the effectiveness of recovery in preventing customer churn. They calibrate it on panel data that track actual purchases, complaints, and recoveries for 20,000 new customers of an Internet and catalog retailer over 2.5 years. Complaints are associated with a substantial increase in the probability that the customer stops buying, but the size of the increase depends on prior customer experiences: prior purchases mitigate the effect, and their impact is long-lasting, whereas prior complaints exacerbate the effect, but their impact is short-lived. Thus, unless the customer leaves the company after a complaint, or a second failure occurs shortly after the first, the relationship quickly returns to normal. Recovery counters the effect of the complaint but, in almost all cases, does not entirely offset it. The authors use simulation to translate the results to financial impact and discuss implications for researchers and managers.

414,"Suppliers in business-to-business (B2B) markets often approach their customers’ customers with marketing activities. However, marketing research lacks an integrative conceptualization of this phenomenon. The authors address this void by conceptualizing a B2B supplier's marketing approaches to indirect customers. Drawing on a literature review and a qualitative empirical study, the authors identify three indirect customer marketing approaches: direct customer downstream support, cooperative indirect customer marketing, and independent indirect customer marketing. They also propose external (value chain–related) and internal (B2B supplier–related) moderators that influence the relationship between a B2B supplier's marketing approaches to indirect customers and its financial performance. The authors argue that although power constellations and product value contribution in the value chain determine the specific indirect customer marketing approach that will lead to financial success, internal professionalization of a B2B supplier's organizational structure and processes further strengthens the positive financial impact of each approach.

415,"International relationships are increasingly critical to business performance. Yet despite a recent surge in international research on relationship marketing (RM), it is unclear whether or how RM should be adapted across cultures. The authors adopt Hofstede's dimensions of culture to conduct a comprehensive, multivariate, metaregression analysis of 47,864 relationships across 170 studies, 36 countries, and six continents. To guide theory, they propose four tenets that parsimoniously capture the essence of culture's effects on RM. Study 1 affirms these tenets and emphasizes the importance of taking a fine-grained perspective to understand the role of culture in RM because of the high degree of heterogeneity across different cultural dimensions and RM linkages. For example, the magnitude of individualism's effect is 71% greater on RM than other cultural dimensions, whereas masculinity has almost no effect; however, accounting only for individualism ignores significant moderating effects of power distance and uncertainty avoidance dimensions. To guide managers, Study 2 adopts a country-level approach and reveals that RM is much more effective outside the United States such that relationships are 55% more effective, on average, for increasing business performance in Brazil, Russia, India, and China.

416,"Increased internal pressure to make marketing accountable, combined with market pressure from the proliferation of new service delivery channels, requires retailers to better understand the differential impacts of marketing efforts across channels now more than ever. In this article, the authors (1) develop and test a theoretically grounded framework for the interplay of objective service performance and direct marketing in shaping retail revenue over time through two distinct service delivery channels (on-site and remote) and (2) conceptualize service delivery channel–specific servicescapes as facilitative mechanisms for the effectiveness of objective service performance and direct marketing. The authors test the conceptual framework with multisource data from a major national pizza retailer comprising a field study based on a time series of 223 weeks across five stores of objective marketing and performance data (delivery time) and a cross-sectional survey of the retailer's customers. They find that objective service performance and direct marketing interact by exhibiting a trade-off effect contingent on specific aspects of the servicescape. When both objective service performance and direct marketing levels are high, servicescape quality design perceptions alleviate the trade-off effect in on-site delivery channels, and servicescape time/effort cost perceptions do so in remote delivery channels. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.

417,"In response to a top ten global consumer trend, firms are increasingly introducing environmentally sustainable (“green”) new products. Firms allocate significant resources to this area; thus, the authors consider the brand-level implications by investigating how the introduction of green new products changes attitude toward the brand. In examining this relationship, they draw from social identity and framing theories to investigate drivers of green new product introductions as well as the moderating effects of message framing, source credibility, and product type. Estimating a three-stage least squares model based on new product introductions from 75 brands across a four-year time period (2009–2012), the authors find that green new product introductions can indeed improve brand attitude and that both the brand and category's positioning influence the introduction of green new products. They also find that the quantity of green messages, the product type, and their source credibility influence the extent to which green new products change brand attitude. The authors use these findings to provide guidance for managers as they attempt to effectively link their green innovation efforts to improve consumer attitudes toward their brands.
","We examine the impact of product-specific brand positioning on the success of a new product. We examine the impact of brand positioning on the success of a new product’s brand in a setting where consumers are heterogeneous in their product preferences. We find that brand positioning positively affects the product’s brand positioning by increasing the likelihood that consumers will purchase the new product. We also find that brand positioning negatively affects the product’s brand positioning by increasing the likelihood that consumers will purchase the new product. We also find that brand positioning negatively affects the product’s brand positioning by increasing the likelihood that consumers will purchase the new product.

418,"Across three studies, this research examines how marketers can capitalize on their brand's standing in the marketplace through strategic logo placement on their packaging. Using a conceptual metaphor framework, the authors find that consumers prefer powerful brands more when the brand logo is featured high rather than low on the brand's packaging, whereas they prefer less powerful brands more when the brand logo is featured low rather than high on the brand's packaging. Furthermore, the authors confirm that the underlying mechanism for this shift in preference is a fluency effect derived from consumers intuitively linking the concept of power with height. Given this finding, the authors then demonstrate an important boundary condition by varying a person's state of power to be at odds with the metaphoric link. The results demonstrate when and how marketers can capitalize on consumers’ latent associations through package design.

419,"The authors examine new product outcomes in the context of regional clusters. On the basis of prior research on marketing relationships, clusters, and social networks, they propose that the overall configuration of a cluster helps promote particular governance practices among its members. These practices have distinct value-creating properties, and when they are brought to bear on a specific new product development project within a cluster, they promote performance outcomes such as product novelty and speed to market. Ultimately, these performance effects are reinforced by the configuration of the cluster itself. In general, the authors propose that new product outcomes result from complex interactions between a cluster's macro-level configuration and its micro-level governance processes. More broadly, their framework points to the importance of geographical variables and to the role of “place” in marketing decision making.

420,"This article is the first to empirically examine the effect of customer loyalty in retail price negotiations. Across three field studies and one negotiation experiment, the authors establish what they call the “loyalty–discount cycle”: in price negotiations with salespeople, loyal customers receive deeper discounts that, in turn, increase customer loyalty, resulting in a downward spiral of a company's price enforcement. The reason for the positive effect of customer loyalty on discount is twofold: (1) loyal customers demand a reward for their loyalty and invoke their elevated perceived negotiation power, and (2) to retain loyal customers, salespeople grant discounts more willingly. Furthermore, the mechanisms are moderated by the basis of a customer's loyalty (price vs. quality) and the length of the relationship between the salesperson and the customer. To escape the loyalty–discount cycle, salespeople can use functional and relational customer-oriented behaviors. The study helps managers and salespeople optimize their price enforcement and servicing of loyal customers.

421,"Firms often utilize salesperson intelligence in marketing strategies to improve sales performance. However, this approach is problematic if the information is based on inaccurate perceptions. In light of this, the authors introduce a theoretical model to study the antecedents and profit impact of salesperson perceptions of customer relationship quality. Dyadic analyses using matched survey responses from salesperson–customer dyads and secondary performance data reveal several insightful findings. Results show that self-efficacious salespeople are upwardly biased, whereas customer-oriented salespeople are downwardly biased in their perceptions of customer relationship quality. However, managers can correct these inaccuracies using a behavior-based control system. Response surface analyses illustrate that the effects of salesperson accuracy and inaccuracy are distinct and curvilinear. During later relationship phases, salespeople profit more from salesperson accuracy in high- and low-quality relationships (i.e., a U-shaped effect). Yet the increasingly harmful impact of salesperson inaccuracy on profit is more severe during earlier relationship phases. Together, these findings highlight the benefits of measuring salesperson perceptions and how to manage them.

422,"Salespeople face increasingly complex work environments, both externally with customers and internally with various departments in their own organizations. Because managing such customer and organizational complexity is crucial to performance, the authors conceptualize and develop measures of customer and organizational complexity and examine the effects on salesperson outcomes. In line with job demands-resources theory, salespeople leverage personal and supervisory resources to manage complexity. The test of the conceptual model uses matched salespeople–sales manager data gathered from a large business-to-business firm. The empirical findings reveal that personal resources (sales self-efficacy) help manage complexity in general but create greater role stress in the face of customer complexity. The effectiveness of supervisory resources (transactional leadership behavior) is contingent on the type of complexity and the personal resources available to a salesperson. These results indicate not only how salespeople manage different complexities but also how sales managers should adapt their leadership behaviors to enhance salesperson performance.

423,"Previous research has identified customer satisfaction and customer–company identification as two of the most important concepts in relationship marketing. Yet despite their proclaimed importance, research on their long-term effectiveness is surprisingly scarce. Furthermore, comparative research acknowledging the concepts' different theoretical roots and illuminating the differences in their long-term effectiveness is lacking. In addition, little is known about how competitive actions affect the long-term effectiveness of both concepts. This study makes a first attempt to address these research gaps and offers a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of customer satisfaction and customer–company identification in driving important customer outcomes over time. Latent growth analyses of rich longitudinal data from customers over nine measurement points spanning 43 weeks (n = 6,930) show that customer satisfaction and customer–company identification have positive initial effects on customers' loyalty and willingness to pay but differ in their ability to maintain these positive effects over time. Whereas the positive effects of customer satisfaction decrease more rapidly, the effects of customer–company identification are significantly more persistent. Analysis of the moderating effects of relative competitive advertising suggests that customer–company identification is more effective at immunizing customers against competitive actions.

424,"Why do some firms not change their strategic orientation despite economic incentives to do so? Most current literature on changing strategic orientations has focused on an antecedents and outcomes approach to business orientations. Intimated, but rarely addressed, are the notions that (1) strategic orientations may be thought of as ideologies and (2) such ideologies are likely to contend with each other. Taking such a perspective may be helpful in discussing why it is challenging to transition to more sustainable strategic orientations even in the presence of financial incentives to do so. In assessing the transition to organic production and marketing in a commodity agriculture context, the authors find that contending ideologies restrict its adoption. In addition, they suggest that strategic orientations are not adopted or contested solely within firms but also among them. The authors find that ideological contestation among firms in this context takes the form of a marketplace drama between a chemical, productionist orientation and an organic orientation in which protagonists mobilize several forms of legitimacy.

425,"Can cause marketing (CM) be effective? If so, do price discounts moderate CM effectiveness? Despite the prevalence of linking product sales with donations to charity, field evidence of CM effectiveness is lacking. This is of particular concern for managers who wonder whether the findings of laboratory experiments extend to actual consumer purchases. Using large-scale randomized field experiments with more than 17,000 consumers, this research documents that CM can significantly increase consumer purchases. Notably, the answer to the second question is more complicated. Under the moderating role of price discounts, the impact of CM on sales purchases may follow an inverted U-shaped relationship—that is, strongest when price discounts are moderate rather than deep or absent. Follow-up lab experiments reveal that consumers' warm-glow good feelings from CM represent the underlying process. These findings provide novel insights into the boundary conditions and mechanisms of the sales impact of CM for researchers and managers alike.
",We examine the impact of consumer-level information on the price of a product. We find that consumers who are more likely to purchase a product with higher information about the product are more likely to purchase a product with lower information about the product. We also find that consumers who are more likely to purchase a product with lower information about the product are more likely to purchase a product with higher information about the product. We also find that consumers who are more likely to purchase a product with lower information about the product are more likely to purchase a product with higher information about the product. We also find that consumers who are more likely to purchase a product with lower information about the product are more likely to purchase a product with higher information about the product.

426,"Previous research has typically treated collection as a top-down process and focused on its later stages. However, collections may start by accident and are often triggered by incidental, bottom-up factors. The authors propose that a small number of possessions (i.e., a few more than one) represent an unjustified and, thus, unstable possession level that prompts a status change. They examine the collection tipping point at which obtaining items belonging to a series (e.g., a couple of collectible Coke cans) often gives rise to a decision to start a collection. Consumers then seek additional items to fulfill their emerging goal. In six lab studies and one field study, the authors investigate the tipping point at which a collection “project” begins and explore the psychological processes underlying that tipping point. In addition, they discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of this research.

427,"Some emerging-market firms have recently achieved substantial growth in developed markets despite having had little prior experience in these markets. What explains the performance of these firms? Building on the organizational learning literature, the authors argue that indirect learning (i.e., learning from the experience of others) plays a crucial role in explaining this phenomenon. Specifically, they propose that emerging-market firms that grow in developed markets overcome their lack of direct experience in such markets by learning indirectly through their leaders, competitors, and interfirm networks. The authors test their thesis by comparing the international growth in developed markets of a sample of emerging-market firms (116 Indian firms) with a sample of developed-market firms (160 U.K. firms). The results support the authors' thesis about the importance of indirect learning in explaining the international growth of emerging-market (relative to developed-market) firms in developed markets. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for policy makers in the areas of higher education, competition policy, and international trade as well as for managers in the areas of middle-management recruitment, competitor analysis and tracking, and managing interfirm networks.
","We examine the role of organizational learning in the emergence of new firms. We argue that the emergence of new firms is driven by the emergence of new knowledge and by the emergence of new knowledge-based firms. We argue that the emergence of new firms is driven by the emergence of new knowledge-based firms that are more likely to be competitive with existing firms. We find that firms with higher levels of knowledge-based knowledge are more likely to enter into competitive competition with existing firms. We also find that firms with higher levels of knowledge-based knowledge are more likely to enter into competitive competition with existing firms. We also find that firms with higher levels of knowledge-based knowledge are more likely to enter into competitive competition with existing firms. We also find that firms with higher levels of knowledge-based knowledge are more likely to enter into competitive competition with existing firms. We discuss the implications of these findings for the theory of organizational learning and the management of organizational learning.

428,"Evolving tastes can change the relative importance of product features in shaping consumers' purchase decisions, which in turn can shift the relative attractiveness of products with different feature levels. The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample. The authors find empirical support for the hypothesis that feature search trends are positively correlated with feature importance trends. They discuss how managers may make better decisions by monitoring feature search trends and leveraging those trends strategically.

429,"Consumers frequently make important financial decisions that have short- and long-term impacts on their welfare. The authors expect that these financial decisions are a function of consumers' past experiences and interactions with a financial services firm as well as consumers' long-term priorities (e.g., national culture). They determine how three cultural dimensions (long-term orientation, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity) and marketing communication type (promotion focused vs. prevention focused) affect three key consumer financial decisions: (1) savings rate, (2) use of credit, and (3) spending pattern. To do so, they empirically test both the direct effect of national culture on consumer financial decision making and its moderating effect on the link between a firm's marketing efforts and consumer financial decision making. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, the authors develop and empirically test their hypotheses using a customer database from a multinational financial services firm based in the United Arab Emirates, with customers originating from 34 countries. They find that national culture directly affects consumer financial decision making and moderates the impact of marketing efforts by the financial services firm, which suggests that financial services firms should account for national culture when managing customers.

430,"Upstream biotech firms (i.e., upstream partners) and downstream pharmaceutical firms (i.e., downstream partners) often form alliances to cope with performance uncertainty and to exploit product specificity in new product development. Although the performance implications of such alliances have been investigated, research has not offered insight into how the timing of such codevelopment alliances influences partner returns. The authors develop and test predictions that timing changes the costs and benefits accruing to upstream and downstream partners and that the effect of timing is influenced by a set of alliance, firm, and market conditions. An event study of 276 codevelopment agreements between biotech and pharmaceutical firms during 1998–2010 reveals that alliance governance structure, partner technological capability, and the competitiveness of market environments change the abnormal returns achieved by partners entering these relationships in important ways.

431,"The present research examines how ambient scents affect consumers' spatial perceptions in retail environments, which in turn influence customers' feelings of power and, thus, product preference and purchasing behavior. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that in a warm- (vs. cool-) scented and thus perceptually more (vs. less) socially dense environment, people experience a greater (vs. lesser) need for power, which manifests in increased preference for and purchase of premium products and brands. This research extends knowledge on store atmospherics and customer experience management through the effects of ambient scent on spatial perceptions and builds on recent research on power in choice contexts.

432,"An increasing body of research addresses consumers' green product purchasing behavior, and yet little work has examined how consumers form perceptions of the greenness of products in the first place. Drawing on theories of attribute centrality (the degree to which an attribute is integral in defining an object), the authors argue that products with identical environmental benefits will be judged more or less green depending on whether the benefit stems from a central versus a peripheral attribute. They present four studies that support the hypotheses and explore factors that influence the effect of central attributes, including product category membership and integration of the green attribute with other elements of the product. They include controls for firm motivations and importance of the attribute to the individual consumer. The authors conclude the article with managerial and public policy implications, such as advice for firms on where to make green investments for maximum consumer impact and insight for public policy makers on the need for consumer assistance in objectively evaluating products with identical environmental benefits that achieve those benefits in different ways.

433,"This research examines how media-induced consumer activation level affects consumer response to highly energetic commercials. Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are experiencing a deactivating emotion (e.g., sadness induced by a movie) find it more difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not experiencing a deactivating emotion. As a result, consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not experiencing a deactivating emotion. The authors do not observe these effects when consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not experience a deactivating emotion. These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces a deactivating emotion (e.g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e.g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a meta-analysis across the present studies show that consumers experiencing a deactivating emotion will respond as much as 50% more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials.

434,"The authors conduct a meta-analysis on the effect of electronic word of mouth on sales by examining 51 studies (involving 339 volume and 271 valence elasticities) and primary data collected on product characteristics (durability, trialability, and usage condition), industry characteristics (industry growth and competition), and platform characteristics (expertise and trustworthiness). Their analysis reveals that electronic word-of-mouth volume (valence) elasticity is .236 (.417). More importantly, the findings show that volume and valence elasticities are higher for privately consumed, low-trialability products that operate in less competitive industries and whose reviews are carried on independent review sites. Furthermore, volume elasticities are higher for durable goods and for reviews on specialized review sites, whereas valence elasticities are greater for community-based sites. Drawing on the results, they discuss several implications for managers and researchers and explain why valence elasticities are often found to be insignificant. Finally, they propose numerous directions for future research in the area on the basis of their findings.

435,"Adopting an institutional theoretic framework, this article examines the evolution and competitive dynamics of markets composed of multiple practices, beliefs, and rule systems. The 30-year historical analysis of the U.S. yoga market illustrates the coexistence of spirituality, medical, fitness, and commercial logics. Using data gathered through archival sources, netnography, in-depth interviews, and participant observations, the authors link shifting emphases on institutional logics and their sustenance to institutional entrepreneurs’ accumulation and transmission of cultural capital, strategies to legitimize plural logics, distinct branding practices, and contestations among the pervading logics. The study offers a managerial framework for managing conflicting demands of logics, conveying brand legitimacy, and creating a coherent brand identity in plural logic markets; in addition, it develops a theoretical account of links between institutional logics, competitive dynamics, and market evolution.

436,"In the context of price discounts, a special type of price promotion, in which savings depend on the outcome of a gamble and are thus uncertain, has recently achieved some popularity. The question arises as to whether such gambled price discounts (GPDs) incur the negative reference price effect—that is, a downward shift in customers’ internal reference price (IRP)—which is often associated with regular price discounts (RPDs). From several studies, including two longitudinal field experiments, the authors find that GPDs indeed alleviate the negative reference price effect: IRPs and actual repurchasing tend to be lower for RPDs than for GPDs and a no-discount control condition. Moreover, the authors explore the psychological underpinnings of these effects and show that the different consequences of GPDs versus RPDs on IRPs are more pronounced if information regarding product quality is limited. The authors demonstrate that findings are robust to variations of GPD discount levels and the probability of winning.
","We study the effects of price-related uncertainty on the performance of a seller’s (i.e., the seller’s) online product reviews. We find that price-related uncertainty is associated with a lower likelihood of a positive review (i.e., a negative review) and a higher likelihood of a negative review (i.e., a positive review). We also find that price-related uncertainty is associated with a lower likelihood of a positive review (i.e., a negative review) and a higher likelihood of a negative review (i.e., a negative review).

Finally, we find that price-related uncertainty is associated with a lower likelihood of a positive review (i.e., a negative review) and a higher likelihood of a negative review (i.e., a negative review).

437,"An essential characteristic of marketing practice and theory is the promotion of exchanges, many of which are funded by money. Marketing literature thus places great emphasis on determining what factors influence consumers to engage in the marketplace. Less understood, however, is how consumers allocate monetary resources to fund exchanges. Scholars have demonstrated that people employ earmarks to segregate money by source, meaning, or purpose. The ethnographic study of provisioning in the current research adds to prior scholarship with an explanation of how money, as a fungible resource, is transformed into moral and social resources by the behavioral process of ascribing earmarks and approaching provisioning. As part of this study, the author develops a typology that incorporates thrift provisioning and splurge provisioning approaches to categorize consumer goals derived from the use of prosaic and indexical earmarks. These goals are defined as economizing, sustaining, treating, and rewarding. The article closes with a discussion of implications for marketing managers and potential avenues for further research.

438,"Despite the popularity and high quality of machine-made products, handmade products have not disappeared, even in product categories in which machinal production is common. The authors present the first systematic set of studies exploring whether and how stated production mode (handmade vs. machine-made) affects product attractiveness. Four studies provide evidence for the existence of a positive handmade effect on product attractiveness. This effect is, to an important extent, driven by perceptions that handmade products symbolically “contain love.” The authors validate this love account by controlling for alternative value drivers of handmade production (effort, product quality, uniqueness, authenticity, and pride). The handmade effect is moderated by two factors that affect the value of love. Specifically, consumers indicate stronger purchase intentions for handmade than machine-made products when buying gifts for their loved ones but not for more distant gift recipients, and they pay more for handmade gifts when purchased to convey love than simply to acquire the best-performing product.

439,"Marketing academics and practitioners alike remain unconvinced about the chief marketing officer's (CMO's) performance implications. Whereas some studies propose that firms benefit financially from having a CMO in the C-suite, other studies conclude that the CMO has little or no effect on firm performance. Accordingly, there have been strong calls for additional academic research regarding the CMO's performance implications. In response to these calls, the authors employ model specifications with varying identifying assumptions (i.e., rich data models, unobserved effects models, instrumental variable models, and panel internal instruments models) and use data from up to 155 publicly traded firms over a 12-year period (2000–2011) to find that firms can indeed expect to benefit financially from having a CMO at the strategy table. Specifically, their findings suggest that the performance (measured in terms of Tobin's q) of the sample firms that employ a CMO is, on average, approximately 15% greater than that of the sample firms that do not employ a CMO. This result is robust to the type of model specification used. Marketing academics and practitioners should find the results intriguing given the existing uncertainty surrounding the CMO's performance implications. The study also contributes to the methodology literature by collating diverse empirical model specifications that can be used to model causal effects with observational data into a coherent and comprehensive framework.

440,"This study measures the value and progress of knowledge produced in marketing research by using meta-analytic effect sizes as a measure of scientific knowledge. The author combines the results of 176 meta-analyses that include data from more than 7,500 primary studies published between 1918 and 2012. The 1,841 meta-analytic effect sizes show that a considerable body of marketing knowledge has been developed, as expressed by a meta-meta-analytic correlation of .24. This medium-sized effect is as strong or stronger than effects that have been found in compilations of meta-analyses in other, more basic fields of inquiry (e.g., psychology), which shows that marketing is a successful academic discipline. The effect sizes vary across subject areas, with pricing showing the strongest effects, followed by consumer behavior; methods and new product development show the weakest effects. This finding reveals different degrees of knowledge production and varying benchmarks to assess the contribution of future research outcomes in these subject areas. Marketing knowledge follows a discontinuous model of progress: knowledge has increased over time, but at a decreasing rate; the marketing field, which is currently characterized by fragmentation and specialization, has reached a stage of maturity. The findings provide implications for further research regarding how to measure, evaluate, and progress knowledge in marketing.

441,"Product design is a source of competitive advantage for companies and is an important driver of company performance. Drawing on an extensive literature review and consumer interviews, the authors define product design and its dimensions. Using data from three samples (6,418 U.S. consumers and 1,083 and 583 European consumers), the authors develop and validate a new scale to measure product design along the dimensions of aesthetics, functionality, and symbolism. In addition, they investigate the impact of these design dimensions on purchase intention, word of mouth, and willingness to pay. The results indicate that the design dimensions positively influence willingness to pay and also have a positive effect on purchase intention and word of mouth, both directly and indirectly through brand attitude.

442,"The recent surge in the importance of shopper marketing has led to an increased need to understand the drivers of unplanned purchases. The authors address this issue by examining how elements of the current shopping trip (e.g., lagged unplanned purchase, cumulative purchases) and previous shopping trips (e.g., average historical price paid by the shopper) determine unplanned versus planned purchases on the current trip. Using a grocery field study and frequent-shopper-program data, the authors estimate competing models to test behavioral hypotheses using a hierarchical Bayesian probit model with state dependence and serially correlated errors. The results indicate that shoppers with smaller trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a self-regulation model (i.e., an unplanned purchase decreases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), but this effect reverses later in the trip. In contrast, shoppers with medium-sized trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a cuing theory model (i.e., an unplanned purchase increases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), and this effect increases as the trip continues. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice.

443,"Firms commonly add small financial benefits to communications designed to acknowledge consumers' loyalty or support. Yet is it always better to provide some financial benefit as opposed to simply saying “thank you”? Although this question has important implications for customer relationship management, research has not yet provided an answer. This article demonstrates that, indeed, a financial acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment with a monetary benefit) can lead to less positive outcomes than offering a verbal acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment without a monetary benefit), a phenomenon termed the “trivialization effect.” The results explain this effect in terms of shifting evaluation standards: whereas a verbal acknowledgement is evaluated relative to verbal gratitude expression norms, a financial acknowledgment is evaluated relative to both verbal norms and customers' monetary expectations. The authors also demonstrate two practical, theory-consistent ways firms can structure financial acknowledgments to eliminate the trivialization effect. Thus, this research shows both the peril of small financial benefits as a means of expressing customer appreciation and practical, low-cost ways to salvage their potential.

444,"Salespeople make two types of judgments about customers in face-to-face interactions: those that are more intuitive and those that are more deliberative. The authors evaluate the influence of accurate intuitive and deliberative judgments on the performance of salespeople. To evaluate this influence, the authors employ matched survey, observational, and objective field data obtained before, during, and after salesperson–customer interactions. The results reveal that accurate intuitive judgments improve selling performance by enabling more appropriate initial sales strategies. These judgments not only help increase the effectiveness of salespeople's selling efforts but also reduce the amount of selling time, resulting in improved selling efficiency. However, performance is compromised when inaccurate deliberative judgments follow accurate intuitive judgments. The findings also identify different antecedents to judgment accuracy. Intuitive accuracy is influenced by domain-specific experience, similarity to the customer, and empathy for the customer, whereas listening skills and customer orientation influence deliberative accuracy.

445,"As concerns about pollution and climate change become more mainstream, the belief that shopping with reusable grocery bags is an important environmental and socially conscious choice has gained prevalence. In parallel, firms have joined policy makers in using a variety of initiatives to reduce the use of disposable plastic bags. However, little is known about how these initiatives might alter other elements of consumers' in-store behavior. Using scanner panel data from a single California location of a major grocery chain, and controlling for consumer heterogeneity, the authors demonstrate that bringing one's own bags increases purchases of not only environmentally friendly organic foods but also indulgent foods. They use experimental methods to further explore the expression of these effects and to consider the effects of potential moderators, including competing goals and store policies. The findings have implications for decisions related to product pricing, placement and assortment, store layout, and the choice of strategies employed to increase the use of reusable bags.
","We examine the impact of consumer choice on the choice of products and services in a retail setting. We find that consumers choose products and services that are more attractive to them, and that consumers choose products and services that are more attractive to them, more likely to use them, and more likely to use them in the future. We also find that consumers choose products and services that are more attractive to them, and that consumers choose products and services that are more attractive to them, more likely to use them, and more likely to use them in the future.

446,"In diverse industries, from grocery retailing to health care, retailers join buying groups to achieve better terms with suppliers. The authors track the buying group membership of Europe's largest grocery retailers over a 15-year period and evaluate why some buying groups are better than others in increasing retailer performance and why different members belonging to the same group do not always benefit equally from their membership. They find that, on average, buying groups indeed generate scale advantages for their members: group scale increases group members' productivity and sales and decreases their cost of goods sold. Still, bigger is not always better. Retailers benefit less from buying group scale when the group is more heterogeneous in terms of member size and when it extends its scope across too many markets. Moreover, the smaller a member is within the group and the more it overlaps with fellow members, the less it benefits.

447,"Service firms, which have high attrition rates, are finding it exceedingly difficult to grow their customer base. Despite their extensive retention efforts, customers still defect. For these firms, “lost” customers may pose a rewarding “last-resort” opportunity. Reacquiring customers who left the firm may help these firms not only regain their lost profits but also usurp profits from competitors. However, some pertinent questions remain as to whether lost customers are worth the investment in reacquisition and whether they will remain profitable if reacquired. This is the first study to empirically demonstrate how (1) the lost customers' first-lifetime experiences and behaviors, (2) the reason for defection, and (3) the nature of the win-back offer made to lost customers are all related to the likelihood of their reacquisition, their second-lifetime duration, and their second-lifetime profitability per month. The study shows that the stronger the first-lifetime relationship with the firm, the more likely a customer is to accept the win-back offer. This study also presents relevant implications for managers interested in identifying new avenues for growth through effective resource allocation on the reacquisition and management of lost customers. Finally, the authors outline if and when managers should choose between maximizing reacquisition and profitability.

448,"This research shows that brand anthropomorphization increases the perceived unfairness of price increases and the perceived fairness of price decreases. First, analyzing a household panel data set, the authors demonstrate the real-world consequences of brand humanization on consumers' price sensitivity. Second, building on the theoretical premise that fairness judgments depend on consumer focus on the self versus others, they find that brand humanization enhances perceived unfairness of price increases for agency-oriented consumers, who tend to maximize their own self-interests. However, for communion-oriented consumers, who generally consider the needs of others, brand humanization increases perceived fairness of both price increases and decreases. Furthermore, because consumers' focus on the self versus others also depends on relationship goals, the nature of consumer–brand relationships interacts with agency–communion orientation to influence the effect of brand humanization on perceived price fairness. For example, exchange relationship norms reduce the power of brand anthropomorphization to enhance perceived fairness of price changes for communion-oriented consumers. In contrast, the communal nature of these relationships makes both agency- and communion-oriented consumers infer greater positive intent from a humanized (vs. nonhumanized) brand, thus leading to a more positive effect of brand humanization on price fairness for price decreases.
",We study the impact of consumer preferences on the quality of a product's price and the quality of its price-related information. We find that consumers' preferences for quality are positively related to the quality of the product's price and the quality of its price-related information. The positive relationship between consumer preferences for quality and price-related information is stronger for products with high-quality information. The negative relationship between consumer preferences for quality and price-related information is stronger for products with low-quality information. The positive relationship between consumer preferences for quality and price-related information is stronger for products with high-quality information. The negative relationship between consumer preferences for quality and price-related information is stronger for products with low-quality information. The positive relationship between consumer preferences for quality and price-related information is stronger for products with high-quality information. The positive relationship between consumer preferences for quality and price-related information is stronger for products with low-quality information.

449,"This research proposes a mechanism to develop long-term donor relationships, a major challenge in the nonprofit industry. The authors propose a metric, donation variety, which captures a donor's breadth of donations with a given nonprofit organization, controlling for the distribution of donations to different initiatives. Using donation data spanning 20 years from a major U.S. public university, the authors find that improvements in donation variety increase the likelihood that the donor will make a subsequent donation, increase the donation amount, and reduce the sensitivity of donations to negative macroeconomic shocks. In the acquisition phase, most donors give to a single initiative, and these decisions are more influenced by a donor's intrinsic motivations. In contrast, as the donor–nonprofit organization relationship develops over time, nonprofit marketing efforts have a more significant influence on a donor's decision to give to multiple initiatives. Finally, the authors conduct a field study that validates the econometric analysis and provides causal evidence that marketing efforts by nonprofit organizations can encourage donors to spread donations across multiple initiatives.

450,"Participants in three studies read advertisements in which messages were delivered either by people or by anthropomorphized agents—specifically, “talking” products. The results indicate that people low in interpersonal trust are more persuaded by anthropomorphized messengers than by human spokespeople because low trusters are more attentive to the nature of the messenger and believe that humans, more than partial humans (i.e., anthropomorphized agents), lack goodwill. People high in interpersonal trust are less attentive about who is trying to persuade them and so respond similarly to human and anthropomorphized messengers. However, when prompted to be attentive, they are more persuaded by human spokespeople than by anthropomorphized messengers due to their belief that humans, more than partial humans, act with goodwill. Under conditions in which attentiveness is low for all consumers, high and low trusters alike are unaffected by the nature of persuasion agents. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for advertisers considering the use of anthropomorphized “spokespeople.”

451,"This study empirically investigates marketing department power in U.S. firms throughout 1993–2008 and assesses its impact on firm performance. Using a new objective measure of marketing department power and a cross-industry sample of 612 public firms in the United States, the results reveal that, in general, marketing department power increased during this time period. Furthermore, the analyses show that a powerful marketing department enhances firms' longer-term future total shareholder returns beyond its positive effect on firms' short-term return on assets (ROA). The findings also reveal that a firm's long-run market-based-asset-building and short-run market-based- asset-leveraging capabilities partially mediate the effect of a firm's marketing department power on its longer-term shareholder value performance and fully mediate the effect on its short-term ROA performance. This research provides new insights for marketing scholars and managers with regard to both marketing's influence within the firm and how investments in building a powerful marketing department affect firm performance.

452,"The authors examine how a firm's financial leverage affects marketing outcomes and consequent firm value. They find that leverage has a dual effect: it reduces customer satisfaction and moderates the relationship between satisfaction and firm value. The burden of making regular interest payments to debt holders pressures managers to generate adequate cash flows. The authors theorize that this may lead marketers to adopt short-term actions such as cutting advertising and research-and-development spending, which can hurt customer satisfaction by lowering perceived quality and perceived value. Furthermore, higher leverage reduces financial flexibility by constraining marketers from exploiting growth opportunities resulting from higher customer satisfaction. The authors empirically show that leverage leads to lower customer satisfaction, with advertising intensity mediating this effect. The negative impact of leverage on satisfaction is more pronounced for service firms and firms in competitive markets. Finally, leverage negatively moderates the customer satisfaction–firm value link. Increases in customer satisfaction are value enhancing at modest levels of leverage, but at very high levels of leverage, increases in satisfaction are value reducing.
","We examine the impact of firm-level incentives on firm-level performance. We find that firms with higher incentives to invest in customer service experience are more likely to improve customer service experience and to improve firm-level performance. However, firms with lower incentives to invest in customer service experience are more likely to improve firm-level performance. We also find that firms with higher incentives to invest in customer service experience are more likely to improve firm-level performance. We also find that firms with lower incentives to invest in customer service experience are more likely to improve firm-level performance. We also find that firms with higher incentives to invest in customer service experience are more likely to improve firm-level performance. We also find that firms with higher incentives to invest in customer service experience are more likely to improve firm-level performance. Our findings suggest that firms with higher incentives to invest in customer service experience are more likely to improve firm-level performance.  We also find that firms with higher incentives to invest in customer service experience are more likely to improve firm-level performance.  Our findings contribute to the literature on customer service experience and firm-level incentives.

453,"Exchange events are fundamental building blocks of business relationships and essential to relationship development. However, some events contribute to incremental relationship development, as predicted by life cycle theories, whereas others spark “turning points” with dramatic impacts on the relationship. Such transformational relationship events are encounters between exchange partners that significantly disconfirm relational expectations (positively or negatively); they result in dramatic, discontinuous change to the relationship's trajectory and often reformulate the relationship itself. With a three-study, multimethod design, the authors (1) establish a foundation for differentiating dramatic and incremental exchange events on the basis of relational versus product expectations and disconfirmations, thus revealing that strong relationships benefit product disconfirmations but harm relational disconfirmations, and (2) conceptualize, define, and differentiate transformational relationship events from other types of disconfirming events and then link them to exchange performance.

454,"Although the value gained from partnership formation (through alliances) or through the firm's position in a network has received significant research attention, little is known about the risks that can accompany this increasing reliance on partners. The authors investigate the change in firm idiosyncratic and systematic risks after the announcement of marketing alliances and analyze whether the density of the firm's network of alliance partners moderates the risk exposure, demonstrated through investors' expectations of a firm's risk or the equity risk of a firm. The results indicate that marketing alliances reduce firm risk, so long as the alliance is a novel connection between the partnering firms. Furthermore, at high levels, the interconnectedness of partners or density of a firm's network can cause idiosyncratic risk to increase, and the density of a partner's network can also result in increases in systematic risk of a firm after alliance formation.

455,"Product recalls tend to damage the stock price of the recalling firm. This article proposes and empirically demonstrates that adjustments to prerecall advertising spending can be used as a tool to moderate this financial damage. Using data on automobile recalls and detailed advertising expenditures from 2005 to 2012, the authors show that adjustments to a firm's prerecall advertising expenditure can either mitigate or amplify the negative effect of the recall on stock market value, depending on the direction of advertising adjustment and the recall characteristics. Boosting ad spending before a recall announcement softens the stock price loss when the recall involves a newly introduced product with a minor hazard but sharpens the loss when the recalled product is an established model with a major hazard. Cutting prerecall advertising worsens the stock price loss when the recall involves a new product, regardless of the hazard. This research also reveals that in product-harm crisis management, profit maximization and shareholder value maximization can conflict with each other, underscoring the importance of developing an integrated crisis management strategy.

456,"The authors explore how firms can enhance consumer performance in online idea generation platforms. Most, if not all, online idea generation platforms offer all consumers identical tasks in which (1) participants are granted access to ideas from other participants and (2) ideas are classified into categories, but consumers can navigate freely across idea categories. The former is linked to stimulus ideas, and the latter may be viewed as a first step toward problem decomposition. The authors propose that the effects of both stimulus ideas and problem decomposition are moderated by consumers' domain-specific knowledge. In particular, concrete cues such as stimulus ideas are more beneficial to low-knowledge consumers, and high-knowledge consumers are better served with abstract cues such as the ones offered by problem decomposition. The authors' hypotheses are supported by an extensive empirical investigation involving more than 6,000 participants. The findings suggest that online idea generation platforms should use problem decomposition more explicitly and that firms should not immediately show other participants' ideas to high-knowledge consumers when they access the platform. In other words, online idea generation platforms should customize the task structure on the basis of each participant's domain-specific knowledge.

457,"Although the study of salesperson performance traditionally has focused on salespeople's activities and relationships with customers, scholars recently have proposed that salespeople's intraorganizational relationships and activities also play a vital role in driving sales performance. Using data from 286 salespeople in a unique social network analysis, the authors explore the effects of salespeople's intraorganizational relationships on objective salesperson performance as well as the role of political skill in developing intraorganizational relationships. The results indicate that two types of social network characteristics (i.e., relational centrality and positional centrality) contribute substantially to salesperson performance. Moreover, salespeople's political skill is shown to be an antecedent to relational centrality but, surprisingly, not positional centrality. This finding demonstrates that researchers should not assume that all centralities represent similar underlying network characteristics. In light of these results, the authors discuss several implications for both managers and researchers as well as directions for further research.
","We examine the relationship between organizational performance and organizational performance in the context of a multilevel network of firms. We find that organizational performance is positively related to the number of employees in the network, and that the relationship is stronger for firms with more employees. We also find that the relationship between organizational performance and organizational performance is stronger for firms with more employees.

458,"Coproduction offerings, in which customers engage in the production of goods and services, are ubiquitous (e.g., ready-to-assemble products, self-service technologies). However, although previous research has predominantly identified beneficial aspects of coproduction in contrast to traditional firm production, the pivotal role of coproduction intensity within coproduction processes has largely been neglected. Furthermore, little is known about strategies that firms can employ to positively influence customers’ perceptions of coproduction processes. Drawing on a large field experiment with 803 customers engaging in actual coproduction processes, the current study makes a first attempt to address these research voids. The results show that coproduction intensity negatively affects customers’ satisfaction with the coproduction process. Furthermore, the study offers first insights into how firms can mitigate these negative effects by employing corporate communication strategies that either emphasize specific coproduction value propositions (value-enhancing communication strategies) or highlight additional coproduction service supplements (intensity-reducing communication strategies).
","We examine how firms’ product offerings interact with each other in the context of a product-to-consumer (P2C) relationship. We find that firms’ product offerings interact with each other in the context of a product-to-consumer (P2C) relationship, and that the interaction between the two is mediated by the product’s intrinsic value and the firm’s intrinsic value. We also find that firms’ product offerings interact with each other in the context of a product-to-consumer (P2C) relationship, and that the interaction between the two is mediated by the firm’s intrinsic value and the firm’s intrinsic value. We also find that firms’ product offerings interact with each other in the context of a product-to-consumer (P2C) relationship, and that the interaction between the two is mediated by the firm’s intrinsic value and the firm’s intrinsic value. Our findings contribute to the literature on product-to-consumer (P2C) relationships and the design of P2C-based P2C networks.  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \ \  \ \",0.7184203,-0.31200764,-0.5076414,-0.13036789,-0.69156444,-0.86777675,-1.5648283,1.5849421,0.481106,0.5000317,-0.21878487,-0.14617541,-0.80334294,-0.29349682,-1.2182485,0.26396582,-0.10979782,0.7382947,0.40407446,0.18449478,-0.19785415,0.001481425,-1.5525508,-0.05600629,-1.0132825,-0.5047619,0.8462938,-0.17406698,0.08336868,-0.03550336,-0.3884047,-0.40534425,-0.546124,-1.8588105,-1.2834738,0.15922937,0.35788125,-0.058746833,-0.7734198,-0.5660042,-0.64753485,1.242787,0.6365876,-0.514838,-0.15235898,0.10012761,-1.1463135,0.6665461,-0.00979113,1.0604944,0.6525032,-0.149597,-0.1680614,-0.5694101,-0.13119392,-0.21766318,-0.71192247,-0.42493385,-0.72555315,0.47099817,0.57355803,1.7983629,-0.60267144,0.47724816,-0.028639961,-0.22741637,-0.089742266,-1.5453463,-0.3367042,0.23099364,-0.18816426,0.8660776,1.6585909,-0.7825096,-0.54811865,0.312516,1.1594086,1.0038396,-0.54258084,-0.06310182,0.8493966,-1.3132002,-0.8392184,0.5718208,0.24677473,1.8551426,-0.073661305,-0.8103098,-2.0113263,-0.45713452,-0.4226165,0.7614734,-0.20844522,-0.7099007,-0.08591833,-1.3030384,0.25085726,-0.5126061,1.0916376,0.43468025,0.058168005,-0.49208888,0.8991888,-0.19872636,-0.39884478,0.22713825,-0.82789326,0.14213136,-0.16500889,0.5982903,0.95642745,1.2488438,0.7168097,0.71528816,0.048001304,0.22956702,-0.46730238,0.7488255,1.229022,2.306801,-1.0221084,-0.25730017,0.21535511,-0.000449521,-0.53936636,-0.29739487,-0.31772342,-1.6114004
459,"Manufacturers and online retailers are readily availing themselves of new technologies to present their merchandise using a variety of formats, including static (still image) and dynamic (video) portrayal. Building on vividness theory, the authors propose and demonstrate that presenting products and services using a dynamic visual format enhances consumer preference for hedonic options and willingness to pay for those options. The dynamic presentation format increases involvement with the product/service experience in a manner presumably similar to that of the actual product experience. The result is an increased preference for and valuation of hedonic options. This holds true for experiential and search products in single and joint evaluations and carries over to subsequent choices. Across all studies, the results demonstrate that a dynamic (relative to static) presentation format enhances choice of the hedonically superior (vs. utilitarian-superior) option by more than 79%.

460,"Companies often extend product lines with the goal of increasing demand for their products and responding to competitive threats. Although line extensions may lead to cannibalization and reduction of overall profit, the bulk of theoretical and empirical research has suggested that product line extensions result in a net gain of overall demand and market share. To mitigate cannibalization, the extant literature prescribes the addition of premium versions of products, or “upward line extensions,” with the intention of achieving gains not only in demand and market share but also in overall profit. In this research, the authors employ analytical and empirical methods to make the case that upward line extensions aimed at matching a competing product's attribute may lead consumers to reassess their perceptions about the brand and the attributes of products in the market in a way that erodes the advantages of the extending firm. Ultimately, this can result in a loss of demand, market share, and profit for the extending firm.

461,"Innovations commonly involve changes to iterated market offerings (e.g., new games, car models, film sequels). To better understand consumer iteration responses, the authors develop and test a theoretical framework grounded in (1) prior innovations serving as reference states (comparators) for later innovations and (2) consumer desires for both comfort and stimulation. In Study 1's online game, prior innovations and loss aversion (greater loss than gain impact) moderate evaluations of current innovations, whereby an introduction-weaker-stronger innovation sequence (Periods 1–3 of four periods) generates more entertainment than an introduction-stronger-weaker sequence because the former's weak-opening-then-rise does less harm than the latter's strong-opening-then-drop. Study 2 replicates Study 1 and shows that an introduction-weaker-weaker sequence produces enough habituation and diminishing negative returns to outperform an introduction-stronger-weaker sequence at Period 4. Study 3 offers marketplace corroboration with a film industry test in which minor (fewer) innovations perform better (e.g., sales, return on investment) earlier in franchises, whereas major (many) innovations perform better later, thereby reconciling prior research's opposing prescriptions for the use of major versus minor sequel innovations. The framework and results implicate carefully sequenced innovations for managing consumer iteration responses, including the possibility of interspersing weaker/minor innovations among stronger/major innovations.

462,"This article demonstrates a new substantive finding: that kinetic property in advertising, defined as direction changes in the paths of moving on-screen ad elements, enhances consumer judgments of product novelty. Across six studies, the authors first outline an inference-based theory as to why the novelty-enhancing effect of kinetic property manifests: kinetic property generates impressions of how visually lively an ad is, which leads to inferences of product atypicality and, consequently, higher novelty judgments. Second, they demonstrate boundary conditions by showing that (1) the positive effect for kinetic property is evident with incremental (and not radical) innovations, (2) the effect dissipates when figure-ground contrast in the ad makes kinetic property less discriminable, (3) contextual adaptation to kinetic property can mitigate this effect, and (4) kinetic property enhances novelty judgments primarily when product category characteristics such as perceived market dynamism match with kinetic property–based executions. The authors offer substantive implications for firms marketing new products as well as for multimedia advertising.

463,"Given the unprecedented reach of social media, firms are increasingly relying on it as a channel for marketing communication. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of firm-generated content (FGC) in social media on three key customer metrics: spending, cross-buying, and customer profitability. The authors further investigate the synergistic effects of FGC with television advertising and e-mail communication. To accomplish their objectives, the authors assemble a novel data set comprising customers’ social media participation data, transaction data, and attitudinal data obtained through surveys. The results indicate that after the authors account for the effects of television advertising and e-mail marketing, FGC has a positive and significant effect on customers’ behavior. The authors show that FGC works synergistically with both television advertising and e-mail marketing and also find that the effect of FGC is greater for more experienced, tech-savvy, and social media–prone customers. They propose and examine the effect of three characteristics of FGC: valence, receptivity, and customer susceptibility. The authors find that whereas all three components of FGC have a positive impact, the effect of FGC receptivity is the largest. The study offers critical managerial insights regarding how to leverage social media for better returns.

464,"Despite the positive societal implications of corporate social responsibility (CSR), there remains an extensive debate regarding its consequences for firm shareholders. This study posits that marketing capability plays a complementary role in the CSR–shareholder wealth relationship. It further argues that the influence of marketing capability will be higher for CSR types with verifiable benefits to firm stakeholders (i.e., consumers, employees, channel partners, and regulators). An analysis utilizing secondary information for a large sample of 1,725 firms for the years 2000–2009 indicates that the effects of overall CSR efforts on stock returns and idiosyncratic risk are not significant on their own but only become so in the presence of marketing capability. Furthermore, the results reveal that although marketing capability has positive interaction effects with verifiable CSR efforts—environment (e.g., using clean energy), products (e.g., providing to economically disadvantaged), diversity (e.g., pursuing diversity in top management), corporate governance (e.g., limiting board compensation), and employees (e.g., supporting unions)—on stock returns (and negative interaction effects with these CSR efforts on idiosyncratic risk), it has no significant interaction effect with community-based efforts (e.g., charitable giving).

465,"Although the returns of customer participation on new product development (NPD) performance can vary substantially, the current literature lacks a systematic conceptual and empirical integration showing when customer participation is valuable in enhancing NPD performance. Building on knowledge management theory, the authors present a conceptual framework that synthesizes a variety of contingency factors. A meta-analysis empirically examines the moderating effects of contextual factors between customer participation and NPD performance. The analysis reveals that involving customers in the ideation and launch stages of NPD improves new product financial performance directly as well as indirectly through acceleration of time to market, whereas customer participation in the development phase slows down time to market, deteriorating new product financial performance. Furthermore, the benefits of customer participation on NPD performance are greater in technologically turbulent NPD projects, in emerging countries, in low-tech industries, for business customers, and for small firms. The authors discuss several theoretical and managerial implications about when to engage customers in the innovation process.

466,"The role of coworkers’ customer orientation (CO) in influencing an employee's CO has received sparse attention in the literature. This research serves two purposes. First, the study draws on person–group fit theory to develop and test a model of a frontline employee's CO relative to that of his or her coworkers as well as the effects of CO (mis)fit on job satisfaction and service performance through coworker relationship quality. Second, the authors propose three work-group characteristics—group size, service climate strength, and leader‒member exchange differentiation—that they expect to mitigate the (negative) positive effect of employee‒coworker CO (mis)fit on coworker relationship quality. Data collected in a multirespondent (i.e., frontline employees and supervisors) longitudinal research design indicate that as group size increases, service climate becomes stronger, and group leaders develop different exchange relationships with employees, the inherently (negative) positive role of employee–coworker CO (mis)fit in influencing coworker relationship quality diminishes. Furthermore, coworker relationship quality fully mediates the associations of employee–coworker CO (mis)fit with job satisfaction and service performance. The authors close with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the boundary conditions of CO (mis)fit.

467,"Prior research has firmly established that consumers draw benefits from a firm's engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR), especially the feeling of a “warm glow.” These benefits positively affect several desirable outcomes, such as willingness to pay and customer loyalty. The authors propose that consumers do not blindly perceive benefits from a firm's CSR engagement but tend to suspect that a firm's prices include a markup to finance the CSR engagement. Taking customers’ benefit perceptions and price markup inferences into account, the authors suggest that CSR engagement has mixed effects on consumers’ evaluation of price fairness and, thus, on subsequent outcomes such as customer loyalty. The authors conduct one qualitative study and four quantitative studies leveraging longitudinal field and experimental data from more than 4,000 customers and show that customers indeed infer CSR price markups, entailing mixed effects of firms’ CSR engagement on price fairness. The authors find that perception critically depends on customers’ CSR attributions, and they explore the underlying psychological mechanisms. They propose communication strategies to optimize the effect of CSR engagement on perceived price fairness.

468,"Marketing relationships have evolved from simple dyadic transactions between the firm and its customers into scenarios in which the firm's frontline employees are required to manage a portfolio of stakeholder relationships. The authors begin by characterizing the “strategic” frontline employee (SFLE) as a focal marketing employee who, in the execution of his or her work, must influence a variety of stakeholder target groups, including (1) customers, (2) the internal business team, and (3) external business partners. The authors leverage data from SFLEs at two firms to explore the similarities and differences in SFLE influence tactic effectiveness across the three stakeholder groups. They find that the effectiveness of influence tactics in driving performance differs across stakeholder target types and, somewhat surprisingly, that the SFLE's influence of both the internal business team and external business partners has a greater effect on his or her performance than does influence directed at customers. The authors close with a discussion of the implications for theory and practice.

469,"Research in marketing has increasingly focused on building knowledge about how firms’ marketing contributes to performance outcomes. A key precursor to accurately diagnosing the value firms’ marketing creates is conceptualizing and operationalizing appropriate ways to assess performance outcomes. Yet, to date, there has been little conceptual development and no systematic examination of how researchers in marketing should conceptualize and measure the performance outcomes associated with firms’ marketing. The authors develop a theory-based performance evaluation framework and examine the assessment of such performance outcomes in 998 empirical studies published in the top 15 marketing journals from 1981 through 2014. The results reveal a large number of different performance outcome measures used in prior empirical research that may be only weakly related to one another, making it difficult to synthesize findings across studies. In addition, the authors identify significant problems in how performance outcomes in marketing are commonly conceptualized and operationalized. They also reveal several theoretically and managerially important performance areas in which empirical knowledge of marketing's impact is limited or absent. Finally, they examine the implications of the results, provide actionable guidelines for researchers, and suggest a road map for systematically improving research practice in the future.
","We examine the impact of information technology (IT) on firm performance. We develop a theoretical framework to examine the impact of IT on firm performance. We develop a model of firm performance that incorporates the characteristics of the firm’s IT-enabled products and the firm’s IT-enabled products’ performance characteristics. We find that firms’ IT-enabled products are more likely to perform better than their IT-enabled products, and that the performance characteristics of the firm’s IT-enabled products are more likely to be more predictive of firm performance. We also find that firms’ IT-enabled products are more likely to perform better than their IT-enabled products’ performance characteristics. We also find that firms’ IT-enabled products are more likely to perform better than their IT-enabled products’ performance characteristics. We discuss the implications of our findings for research and practice. We discuss the implications of our findings for practice and the management of IT-enabled products.

470,"Understanding factors that influence online shopping and managing consumer relationships is not a trivial task for firms, considering the many pertinent factors that influence behavior, including the product being shopped (i.e., the “what”) and the context of the website itself (i.e., the “where”). This study investigates the impact of these characteristics on an online transaction's basket value, after incorporating the role of other aspects of the browsing process including page views and visit duration. The authors estimate a multivariate mixed-effects Type II Tobit model with a system of equations to explain variation in shopping basket value, using data involving 773,262 browsing sessions resulting in 9,664 transactions across 43 product categories from 385 unique websites. The results support the assertions that contextual factors are associated with online browsing. For example, a website's scope in terms of product variety is associated positively with visit durations and basket values but negatively with page views. Furthermore, a website's communication functionality is positively associated with basket value for hedonic products. Insights suggest managerial implications involving product and website strategies for online retailers.

471,"Introducing new products necessitates that manufacturers not only carefully craft the initial contract terms with retailers but also consider how the specificity of the terms influences a retailer's relational behaviors throughout the duration of the contract, contingent upon the new product's success. The authors develop a series of hypotheses to investigate new product introductions using a multimethod design consisting of a survey of manufacturers and a repeated measures experiment with retailers. The results indicate that manufacturers craft increasingly specific contract terms as new product creativity increases when frequency of new product introductions and performance ambiguity are higher. When they are lower, the positive influence of new product creativity on contract specificity weakens and can in some instances become negative. The results also indicate that there is no significant change in a retailer's relational behaviors throughout a contract's duration when contract specificity is lower, regardless of the new product's success. However, under the condition of higher contract specificity, the retailer's relational behaviors increase (decrease) over a contract's duration when the new product is successful (unsuccessful).
",We examine the impact of product design on product quality and product quality outcomes in a firm that is faced with a dynamic product market. We find that product design influences product quality by increasing the number of product prototypes and by increasing the number of product prototypes that are produced. Product prototypes are produced more frequently and are more likely to be completed in the first place. Product prototypes are also more likely to be completed in the second place. Product prototypes are also more likely to be completed in the third place. Product prototypes are also more likely to be completed in the fourth place. Product prototypes are also more likely to be completed in the fifth place. Product prototypes are also more likely to be completed in the sixth place. Product prototypes are also more likely to be completed in the seventh place. Product prototypes are also more likely to be completed in the eighth place. Product prototypes are also more likely to be completed in the ninth place. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of product prototypes and the design of product prototypes in the context of product design.  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \,0.30021387,0.30828983,-0.24876326,0.06932219,0.5977518,-0.1302771,-0.3203003,1.3563247,1.1038387,0.27645576,0.7895153,-0.8733143,0.70976007,-0.18657485,0.034907043,0.25428617,0.8104646,0.9369439,1.2300361,0.49631423,0.42537293,0.5078854,-0.26834247,0.5321533,-1.4117894,0.20155972,1.5886605,0.023332756,0.65810525,-1.2244167,-0.3098952,0.33398643,-0.48129484,-1.2939293,-0.96908385,0.76716506,0.91595954,-0.23149444,-0.8398095,0.8998951,-0.28660834,0.888369,-0.16536354,-0.96368134,0.42790124,-0.8622428,-1.7687634,0.19637899,-0.5203974,0.9945956,0.60788614,-0.04485079,1.3146076,-0.29327545,-1.3199866,0.12873432,-0.24143374,-0.7508156,-0.9957255,-0.60604346,-0.28132194,1.7307655,-1.2834976,-0.028575452,0.3921318,-0.46471053,-0.52006346,-0.6889147,-0.5078231,-0.06768227,1.2879869,0.6432437,-0.18675254,-1.6929114,-0.26558435,-0.35241744,-0.049538236,0.7541154,-0.95365757,-0.050004996,0.010658909,-1.433357,-0.3884812,1.5610299,0.25553426,1.9502332,0.99288994,-0.8087335,-0.8196193,-0.71634567,-0.25136802,-0.105902866,0.83905864,-0.5993257,-0.25186282,-1.7284229,-0.09123693,-0.061933655,0.7721534,-0.42199302,0.67119044,-0.9326279,0.583279,-0.8633652,0.85979146,0.6165873,-0.8212764,0.035741124,-0.82912666,-0.24050127,0.578595,0.78536713,0.23749395,0.6433515,0.7780142,-1.4599665,0.6645849,0.07864189,0.24709104,1.9809682,1.2667986,0.6968997,-1.1134324,-0.49849448,-0.32709527,-0.9203031,0.8986713,-1.9200581
472,"The authors address the questions of whether and how corporate social responsibility (CSR) relates to firm performance and, in so doing, identify four mechanisms pertaining to this relationship: (1) slack resources lead to CSR (i.e., slack resources mechanism) (2) CSR improves performance (i.e., good management mechanism), (3) CSR makes amends for past corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) (i.e., penance mechanism), and (4) CSR insures against subsequent CSI (i.e., insurance mechanism). Using an integrative approach, the authors incorporate the four mechanisms in their empirical model specification. Specifically, to model the interplay among CSR, CSI, and firm performance and to test the four mechanisms simultaneously, they propose a structural panel vector autoregression specification. In support of the good management mechanism, results from an unbalanced panel data set of more than 4,500 firms and up to 19 years suggest that firms that engage in CSR are likely to benefit financially from their CSR investments. Moreover, the authors do not find support for the slack resources or the insurance mechanism. In contrast, and in support of the penance mechanism, often firms' CSR seems to trail their CSI.

473,"In-process promotions focus on promotional activities during marketing events such as auctions, crowdfunding, or fund-raising. Firms can observe consumers’ responses to these promotions and use this information to adjust future promotions sent during the same events. The authors study the impact of promotions on market outcomes and focus on one use of such promotions: messages sent during online auctions, in which the outcome is the final auction price. They propose that the effect of these messages can be understood by observing their aggregate impact on final auction prices and by examining how messages affect behaviors at the bid level, namely, new-bidder entry and jump bidding. These bid-level behaviors can, when summed at the auction level, affect auction prices. Besides examining the messages’ impact on bidder behavior, the authors study the auctioneer's strategy in issuing these messages. They distinguish between informative messages, which focus on product attributes, and persuasive messages, which try to motivate the message recipients to bid. They test hypotheses derived from their framework using data from online auctions of Air France airline tickets. The authors also conduct “what-if” simulations to help auctioneers identify the optimal number of messages to send during an auction.

474,"Innovation commercialization, an important managerial challenge, depends heavily on the sales force for its success. However, little empirical research has examined how firms should direct sales reps in this task in a global, multicultural context. Drawing on self-determination theory, this study investigates how to motivate sales reps for innovation selling in different cultures with various financial and nonfinancial steering instruments. The authors collected data in two waves from sales reps in 38 countries on four continents, making this study one of the largest international investigations in sales research. Results reveal that steering instruments should correspond closely with reps’ national culture in terms of power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation. For example, findings show that whereas individualism strengthens the positive relationship between variable compensation for innovation-sales results and financial innovation performance through innovation-selling motivation, power distance and uncertainty avoidance weaken this relationship. Results also reveal that long-term orientation strengthens the positive relationship between supervisor appreciation for innovation-sales results and financial innovation performance through innovation-selling motivation.

475,"Social media sites have created a reverberating “echoverse” for brand communication, forming complex feedback loops (“echoes”) between the “universe” of corporate communications, news media, and user-generated social media. To understand these feedback loops, the authors process longitudinal, unstructured data using computational linguistics techniques and analyze them using econometric methods. By assembling one of the most comprehensive data sets in the brand communications literature with corporate communications, news stories, social media, and business outcomes, the authors document the echoverse (i.e., feedback loops between all of these sources). Furthermore, the echoverse has changed as online word of mouth has become prevalent. Over time, online word of mouth has fallen into a negativity spiral, with negative messages leading to greater volume, and firms are adjusting their communications strategies in response. The nature of brand communications has been transformed by online technology as corporate communications move increasingly from one to many (e.g., advertising) to one to one (e.g., Twitter) while consumer word of mouth moves from one to one (e.g., conversations) to one to many (e.g., social media). The results indicate that companies benefit from using social media (e.g., Twitter) for personalized customer responses, although there is still a role for traditional brand communications (e.g., press releases, advertising). The evolving echoverse requires managers to rethink brand communication strategies, with online communications becoming increasingly central.
","We study the impact of social media on the information technology (IT) industry’s digital transformation. We use a unique data set of more than 1,000 tweets from a leading online social media platform, Twitter, to examine the impact of social media on the information technology (IT) industry’s digital transformation. We find that social media (“Twitter”) has a significant impact on the information technology (IT) industry’s digital transformation. We find that social media’s impact on the information technology (IT) industry’s digital transformation is driven by the following: (1) the number of tweets that are retweeted by users, (2) the number of tweets that are retweeted by users’ followers, and (3) the number of tweets that are retweeted by users’ followers.

476,"In recent years, companies have been confronted with a new type of negative consumer behavior: consumers who have turned hostile and who are strongly determined to cause damage to the brand. Empowered by new technological possibilities, an individual consumer can now wreak havoc on a brand with relatively little effort. In reflection of this new phenomenon, the authors introduce the concept of consumer brand sabotage (CBS). On the basis of different underlying motives, a conceptual framework distinguishes CBS (a form of hostile aggression: harming the brand as dominant motive) from other forms of negative consumer behavior, such as customer retaliation and negative word of mouth (instrumental aggression: harming a brand is only a means to achieve other objectives, e.g., restoring equity). This framework adapts insights from aggression and appraisal theories as well as qualitative interviews with actual saboteurs to a consumer–brand relationship context in order to develop an improved theoretical understanding of the under-researched phenomenon of CBS. The authors analyze the mental escalation processes of individual consumers toward CBS and develop a road map for future research.

477,"A key decision for the design of principal–agent agreements is how much control or authority the buyer (or principal) should be allowed to exercise in relation to the seller (or agent). Historically, agency theory has viewed exchange agreements as ranging from those in which the buyer has very high authority over the seller (formal authority) to those in which the buyer and seller are relatively independent so there is little or no authority relation (market exchange). However, some principal–agent agreements reverse the authority relationship usually assumed in agency theory by allowing the seller to exercise authority over the buyer. The authors study this unexplored type of agency agreement and refer to it as “authority relinquishment.” Using data collected from interviews with clients and guides on commercial high-altitude mountain expeditions, the authors identify conditions that make authority relinquishment likely. They also identify the benefits and drawbacks of authority relinquishment and compare them with the benefits and drawbacks of two frequently studied approaches to managing agency relationships—formal authority and authority decentralization.

478,"Market orientation (MO) and marketing performance measurement (MPM) are two of the most widespread strategic marketing concepts among practitioners. However, some have questioned the benefits of extensive investments in MO and MPM. More importantly, little is known about which combinations of MO and MPM are optimal in ensuring high business performance. To address this research gap, the authors analyze a unique data set of 628 firms with a novel method of configurational analysis: fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. In line with prior research, the authors find that MO is an important determinant of business performance. However, to reap its benefits, managers need to complement it with appropriate MPM, the level and focus of which vary across firms. For example, whereas large firms and market leaders generally benefit from comprehensive MPM, small firms may benefit from measuring marketing performance only selectively or by focusing on particular dimensions of marketing performance. The study also finds that many of the highest-performing firms do not follow any of the particular best practices identified.

479,"When product recalls occur, companies provide corrective or compensation measures to consumers for the defective products they have purchased. These remedies directly affect consumers and the effectiveness of recall. This article examines the determinants of remedy choices with a theoretical framework rooted in the basic trade-off between remedy cost and consumer harm. In addition to recall and company characteristics, the authors also consider the impact of the CEO's personal incentives. Using recalls issued by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the authors find that companies prefer to avoid full remedy when remedy cost is high, yet they are more likely to provide full remedy for more severe product hazards. The results show that CEOs’ personal interests interfere with remedy decisions: full remedy is less likely when the CEO receives greater cash compensation or less equity incentive, and when the CEO has longer tenure in the position. Importantly, the CEO's financial interests further moderate the effects of remedy cost and consumer harm. The findings have important implications for recall strategy, consumer welfare, public policy, and leadership ethics.

480,"Many manufacturers look to business solutions to provide growth; however, success is far from guaranteed, and it is unclear how such solutions can create superior perceived value. This article explores what constitutes value for customers from solutions over time—conceptualized as “value in use”—and how this arises from quality perceptions of the solution's components. The authors develop a framework for solution quality and value in use through 36 interviews combining repertory grid technique and means-end chains. The findings significantly extend the extant view of quality as a function of the supplier's products and services, and show that customers also assess the quality of their own resources and processes, as well as the quality of the joint resource integration process. The authors report that value in use corresponds not just to collective, organizational goals but also to individuals’ goals, a finding that strongly contrasts with prior research. Four moderators of the quality–value relationship demonstrate customer heterogeneity across both firms and roles within what the authors term the “usage center.” When shifting toward solutions, manufacturers require very different approaches to market research; account management; solution design; and quality control, including the need for value-auditing processes.

481,"The authors study the drivers and performance implications of retailers’ branding strategies for their premium and economy private-label tiers. Retailers can opt for store-banner branding and use their store-banner name and/or logo to reveal their ownership, or they can use stand-alone branding and avoid an explicit link between store brand and retail banner. Hypotheses are tested on a large pan-European sample of premium and economy tiers that were introduced over almost 15 years. For the premium tier, retailers’ propensity to use store-banner branding is higher when they have a hi–lo price format and a higher brand equity, and when they have used store-banner branding in the past (on their standard tier and in other markets). The attractiveness of using store-banner branding for the premium tier also varies across countries: it is more likely to be chosen when the retail environment is less concentrated, when uncertainty avoidance and rule of law are higher, and when power distance is lower. For most of these drivers, the effect is significantly weaker for the economy tier. Retailers whose premium-tier branding decision is congruent with the proposed contingency framework perform better. For the economy tier, congruence is not associated with higher performance.

482,"This study examines the optimization of interrelease timing decisions, focusing on box office and DVD sales in the U.S. motion picture industry. It aims to improve managerial decision making by jointly modeling the revenue in these two channels through a copula modeling approach. As in previous studies, the authors find that the time lag from box office release to DVD release should be increased to optimize total movie performance, but they conclude that previous studies have systematically underestimated the optimal time lag. This study is the first to challenge the assumption of a negative decay in DVD performance as a function of time; its results suggest that a delayed DVD release is still optimal for maximizing revenue in the DVD channel. This study's model suggests that, on average, individual movies are approximately eight weeks away from their optimal lag and that the net impact of optimizing would be improvements in total and DVD revenue by 2.5% and 5.6%, respectively. Therefore, this model is expected to enhance managerial decision making by offering the ability to predict the optimal time lag for individual movies.

483,"Firms spend billions of dollars on advertising every year but remain uncertain about allocation across various advertising vehicles. Allocation decisions are even more complex as online advertising has proliferated and consumers’ media usage patterns have become more fragmented. To determine advertising effectiveness, the authors group firms’ advertising vehicle choices into three theoretically grounded and empirically verified smaller subsets: national, regional, and online advertising. Subsequently, they assess how the three advertising vehicles independently and jointly affect firm performance. Using 12 years of data covering 662 manufacturing firms, the authors find that while national, regional, and online advertising each have a positive and significant main effect on firm performance, each advertising vehicle weakens the effectiveness of the respective other two advertising vehicles (e.g., a 1% increase in online advertising increases firm performance by .32% but also decreases national [.15%] and regional [.03%] advertising effectiveness). A battery of robustness checks triangulates this result. Although all three media vehicles contribute to net increases in performance, the authors discuss the need to strategically integrate them to maximize combined effectiveness.

484,"In Study 1, the authors find that people are more satisfied with a service experience when they choose to participate in the provider's voluntary green program (e.g., recycling)—an effect mediated by the “warm glow” of participation. The downside, however, is that this same mechanism decreases satisfaction among people who choose not to participate. In Study 2, analysis of data from the J.D. Power Guest Satisfaction Index suggests that incentivizing the program (i.e., compensating the program participants) paradoxically increases satisfaction for those who do not participate but decreases satisfaction among those who do. Studies 3 and 4 explore how manipulating incentive characteristics might enable managers to maximize satisfaction for both groups. Study 3 indicates that, compared with no incentive, an “other-benefiting” incentive increases warm glow and satisfaction for green program participants but decreases them among nonparticipants. Study 4, however, suggests that mixed incentive bundles (i.e., providing both self-benefiting and other-benefiting options) maximize warm glow and satisfaction for both groups—the ideal outcome for managers.
","We study the effects of a “social benefit” (social benefit) on the performance of a service provider (SSP). We find that the social benefit effect is stronger for service providers who are more likely to offer a service and who are more likely to offer a service with a higher level of service quality. We also find that the social benefit effect is stronger for service providers who are more likely to offer a service with a higher level of service quality. We also find that the social benefit effect is stronger for service providers who are more likely to offer a service with a higher level of service quality. We also find that the social benefit effect is stronger for service providers who are more likely to offer a service with a higher level of service quality. We also find that the social benefit effect is stronger for service providers who are more likely to offer a service with a higher level of service quality.

485,"This research examines the relationship between product design and market share, a topic of considerable significance that has not been addressed in the published literature. Drawing from diverse disciplines such as marketing, industrial design, and engineering, the authors conceptualize design as being composed of three distinct product-level dimensions: function, form, and ergonomics. Furthermore, the authors examine the interplay among these design dimensions and their impact on the market share of a product. Empirical results using integrated repeated cross-sectional data obtained from several different sources in the U.S. light vehicle industry reveal an important strategic trade-off concerning design capabilities. Firms can either “design for satisfaction,” by investing in both function and ergonomics, or “design for delight,” by investing in form design capabilities so as to reap share rewards. The authors also show that older-generation vehicles with superior form designs do much better in terms of share than corresponding older vehicles with higher levels of either function or ergonomics. Implications of these results for academic researchers and managers are discussed.

486,"Trade shows are a popular venue for firms to demonstrate their portfolio of market-ready new products as well as product concepts under different stages of development. Utilizing auto shows as a context, the authors investigate the effects of concept and product demonstrations on the demonstrating firm's value. Event study results show that abnormal returns follow an inverted U-shaped effect of product development stages: that is, previously demonstrated concepts approaching potential launch have the strongest positive effect, followed by early-stage concepts demonstrated for the first time to the world (i.e., debuts), and then market-ready new products. Trade show locations mediate these effects. The effects of early-stage debut demonstrations appear only when concepts are presented in trade shows located in the home country of the demonstrating firm. However, the effects of displaying previously demonstrated concepts, which have survived product development hurdles, are present in venues within as well as outside the firm's home country.

487,"How users consume media has shifted dramatically as viewers migrate from traditional broadcast channels toward online channels. Rather than following the schedule dictated by television networks and consuming one episode of a series each week, many viewers now engage in binge watching, which involves consuming several episodes of the same series in a condensed period of time. In this research, the authors decompose users’ viewing behavior into (1) whether the user continues the viewing session after each episode viewed, (2) whether the next episode viewed is from the same or a different series, and (3) the time elapsed between sessions. Applying this modeling framework to data provided by Hulu.com, a popular online provider of broadcast and cable television shows, the authors examine the drivers of binge watching behavior, distinguishing between user-level traits and states determined by previously viewed content. The authors simultaneously investigate users’ response to advertisements. Many online video providers support their services with advertising revenue; thus, understanding how users respond to advertisements and how advertising affects subsequent viewing is of paramount importance to both advertisers and online video providers. The results of the study reveal that advertising responsiveness differs between bingers and nonbingers and that it changes over the course of online viewing sessions. The authors discuss the implications of their results for advertisers and online video platforms.

488,"A common assumption made in structural approaches to empirical strategy research in marketing is that firms and consumers satisfy the assumptions of dynamic optimality when making decisions. When faced with problems of how best to allocate resources, firms are assumed consider the future consequences of different strategic options and, in each point in time, choose the option that maximizes long-term utility. The validity of such assumptions, however, is often called into question by behavioral researchers who point to work in psychology that finds that assumptions of optimality are frequently violated in experimental settings. If this is indeed the case, it would lend support to approaches that argue that markets have inefficiencies that can be discovered and exploited by simpler, largely correlational, methods. In this article, the authors attempt to reconcile these contrasting views by proposing a framework for assessing when assumptions of dynamic optimality are likely to be good ones and when they are likely to be untenable in empirical analysis.
",We study the problem of designing and managing a portfolio of firms that are subject to uncertain market conditions. We develop a framework that allows us to analyze the choices of firms in a market where uncertainty is high and uncertainty is low. We show that the optimal portfolio of firms is a complex problem that can be formulated in terms of a set of discrete choice models. We show that the optimal portfolio of firms is a complex problem that can be formulated in terms of a set of discrete choice models.

489,"Retailers determine the assortment for a mix of product categories in a particular space (e.g., the checkout aisle, endcaps, freezer space). Within such a “target” space, shoppers are exposed to a selection of product categories that are not necessarily correlated in consumption. In this article, the authors examine whether the assortment of one category affects consumers’ purchase incidence decision in another, independent category that shares a common display space (e.g., frozen meals and ice cream). They use a multivariate probit model of purchase incidence and incorporate assortment variety captured by an entropy measure. Results from analyses of IRI data and an online experiment provide strong evidence that consumers are less likely to purchase from a category of a given assortment when it is presented with another category assortment of greater variety and that this effect is driven by the display proximity. Furthermore, results from an eye-tracking study indicate consumers’ allocation of limited attention to category assortments as an explanation for the finding. This work serves as one of the first studies to document the impact of product assortment beyond a focal category, and the results highlight a limitation of individual category management when grocery retailers make product assortment decisions.
",We examine the impact of product categories on the purchase of a product. We use a unique data set of product categories to examine the impact of product categories on the purchase of a product. We find that product categories increase the likelihood of purchase by consumers who are more likely to purchase a product category than by consumers who are less likely to purchase a product category. We also find that product categories increase the likelihood of purchase by consumers who are more likely to purchase a product category than by consumers who are less likely to purchase a product category.

490,"Firms routinely engage in relationship marketing (RM) efforts to improve their relationships with business partners, and extant research has documented the effectiveness of various RM strategies. According to the perspective proposed in this article, as customers migrate through different relationship states over time, not all RM strategies are equally effective, so it is possible to identify the most effective RM strategies given customers’ states. The authors apply a multivariate hidden Markov model to a six-year longitudinal data set of 552 business-to-business relationships maintained by a Fortune 500 firm. The analysis identifies four latent buyer–seller relationship states, according to each customer's level of commitment, trust, dependence, and relational norms, and it parsimoniously captures customers’ migration across relationship states through three positive (exploration, endowment, recovery) and two negative (neglect, betrayal) migration mechanisms. The most effective RM strategies across migration paths can help firms promote customer migration to higher performance states and prevent deterioration to poorer ones. A counterfactual elasticity analysis compares the relative importance of different migration strategies at various relationship stages. This research thus moves beyond extant RM literature by focusing on the differential effectiveness of RM strategies across relationship states, and it provides managerial guidance regarding efficient, dynamic resource allocations.

491,"Interconnect standards increase choices. For example, in cardiac pacemakers, the IS-1 standard enables the “pulse generator” from 6 manufacturers to be combined with the “lead set” from the other 5 to create up to 30 additional mixed-brand pacemakers. However, observed assortment additions are much smaller, which is puzzling because manufacturers in extant models have welcomed such additions to reduce price competition and increase variety. Instead, conflict with the value-added resellers that create and carry these additions is commonplace. The authors extend the literature with an analytical model showing that value-added resellers limit the number and composition of additions to gain better upstream terms. This conflict is exacerbated when “keystone” components are relatively more decisive in influencing customer choices, so their exclusion from an addition represents a larger loss. The empirical study of the multibillion-dollar auto paint refinish market finds assortment additions consistent with the authors’ predictions. The article concludes with a discussion of the role of channel support programs in ameliorating these conflicts.

492,"A debate about whether firms with superior customer satisfaction earn superior stock returns has been persistent in the literature. Using 15 years of audited returns, the authors find convincing empirical evidence that stock returns on customer satisfaction do beat the market. The recorded cumulative returns were 518% over the years studied (2000–2014), compared with a 31% increase for the S&P 500. Similar results using back-tested instead of real returns were found in the United Kingdom. The effect of customer satisfaction on stock price is, at least in part, channeled through earnings surprises. Consistent with theory, customer satisfaction has an effect on earnings themselves. In addition, the authors examine the effect of stock returns from earnings on stock returns from customer satisfaction. If earnings returns are included among the risk factors in the asset pricing model, the earnings variable partially mitigates the returns on customer satisfaction. Because of the long time series, it is also possible to examine time periods when customer satisfaction returns were below market. The reversal of the general trend largely resulted from short-term market idiosyncrasies with little or no support from fundamentals. Such irregularities have been infrequent and eventually self-correcting. The authors provide reasons why irregularities may occur from time to time.

493,"The authors reexamine the relation between customer satisfaction (measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index) and long-term stock returns using statistical tests that are well specified in the presence of industry clustering. Their results are consistent with those of Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult (2016), who find positive abnormal stock returns for companies with high levels of customer satisfaction. However, the authors also identify three caveats that could affect the robustness of this conclusion. First, the results critically depend on the manner in which industry is defined. Second, because Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult use a proprietary trading strategy that has not been disclosed to the general public, the authors are unable to discern what fraction of their reported performance is due to customer satisfaction as opposed to other characteristics of the trading strategy. Finally, because the authors also find positive abnormal returns for the entire American Customer Satisfaction Index sample, at least some of the performance reported by Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult might be driven by sample characteristics unrelated to customer satisfaction. This article also provides useful guidance for measuring long-term abnormal returns in the presence of industry clustering.

494,"The question of whether customer satisfaction is mispriced by the stock market has been debated over the past decade, yet it remains unintegrated with the broader asset pricing literature. The authors critique Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult (2016), focusing on that article's missed opportunities in addressing theoretical lacuna and empirical challenges that might establish the satisfaction mispricing anomaly. In doing so, they distinguish mispricing from value relevance, classify two broad avenues for satisfaction mispricing research, and detail the scope of future research under each avenue. They conclude by summarizing specific research opportunities and presenting implications for managers, investors, and educators that could lead marketing to become a net contributor to the marketing–finance dialogue.

495,"Sorescu and Sorescu (2016) and Bharadwaj and Mitra (2016) have made a number of insightful observations and suggestions for future research regarding stock returns on customer satisfaction. They have also provided a series of assessments of a study by Fornell, Morgeson, and Hult (2016) that focus on abnormal returns on customer satisfaction. Building on the original study, as well as the two commentaries and previous research, the study's authors argue that the published empirical evidence is quite consistent in favor of abnormal returns on customer satisfaction. These findings are also supported by the new analysis of Sorescu and Sorescu, who make several important contributions, not only regarding the persistence of abnormal returns over and beyond the technology sector but also with respect to the critical importance of industry classification in the context of customer satisfaction—something that definitely calls for more research attention. In fact, there are many avenues for future research on the economic and financial impact of customer satisfaction, as laid out in the commentaries, the authors’ original article, and this response.

496,"Marketing organization is the interface of the firm with its markets and where the work of marketing gets done. This review of the past 25 years of scholarship on marketing organization examines the individual and integrative roles of four elements of marketing organization—capabilities, configuration (including structure, metrics, and incentives), culture, and the human capital of marketing leadership and talent. The authors indicate that these four elements are mobilized through seven marketing activities (7As) that occur during the marketing strategy process. These activities enable the firm to anticipate market changes, adapt the strategy to stay ahead of competition, align the organization to the strategy and market, activate effective implementation, ensure accountability for results, attract resources, and manage marketing assets. How well the firm manages these seven activities throughout the marketing strategy process determines the performance payoffs from marketing organization. Future research priorities outlined for the elements of marketing organization, their integration, and their impact on the 7As offer directions for the study of organizing for marketing excellence.

497,"One of the most important tasks in marketing is to create and communicate value to customers to drive their satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability. In this study, the authors assume that customer value is a dual concept. First, in order to be successful, firms (and the marketing function) have to create perceived value for customers. Toward that end, marketers have to measure customer perceived value and have to provide customer perceptions of value through marketing-mix elements. Second, customers in return give value through multiple forms of engagement (customer lifetime value, in the widest sense) for the organization. Therefore, marketers need to measure and manage this value of the customer(s) to the firm and have to incorporate this aspect into real-time marketing decisions. The authors integrate and synthesize existing findings, show the best practices of implementation, and highlight future research avenues.

498,"Understanding customer experience and the customer journey over time is critical for firms. Customers now interact with firms through myriad touch points in multiple channels and media, and customer experiences are more social in nature. These changes require firms to integrate multiple business functions, and even external partners, in creating and delivering positive customer experiences. In this article, the authors aim to develop a stronger understanding of customer experience and the customer journey in this era of increasingly complex customer behavior. To achieve this goal, they examine existing definitions and conceptualizations of customer experience as a construct and provide a historical perspective of the roots of customer experience within marketing. Next, they attempt to bring together what is currently known about customer experience, customer journeys, and customer experience management. Finally, they identify critical areas for future research on this important topic.

499,"The authors provide a critical examination of marketing analytics methods by tracing their historical development, examining their applications to structured and unstructured data generated within or external to a firm, and reviewing their potential to support marketing decisions. The authors identify directions for new analytical research methods, addressing (1) analytics for optimizing marketing-mix spending in a data-rich environment, (2) analytics for personalization, and (3) analytics in the context of customers’ privacy and data security. They review the implications for organizations that intend to implement big data analytics. Finally, turning to the future, the authors identify trends that will shape marketing analytics as a discipline as well as marketing analytics education.

500,"With the challenges presented by new media, shifting media patterns, and divided consumer attention, the optimal integration of marketing communications takes on increasing importance. Drawing on a review of relevant academic research and guided by managerial priorities, the authors offer insights and advice as to how traditional and new media such as search, display, mobile, TV, and social media interact to affect consumer decision making. With an enhanced understanding of the consumer decision journey and how consumers process communications, the authors outline a comprehensive framework featuring two models designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated marketing communication programs: a “bottom-up” communications matching model and a “top-down” communications optimization model. The authors conclude by suggesting important future research priorities.

501,"Over the past 15 years, digital media platforms have revolutionized marketing, offering new ways to reach, inform, engage, sell to, learn about, and provide service to customers. As a means of taking stock of academic work's ability to contribute to this revolution, this article tracks the changes in scholarly researchers’ perspectives on three major digital, social media, and mobile (DSMM) marketing themes from 2000 to 2015. The authors first use keyword counts from the premier general marketing journals to gain a macro-level view of the shifting importance of various DSMM topics since 2000. They then identify key themes emerging in five-year time frames during this period: (1) DSMM as a facilitator of individual expression, (2) DSMM as decision support tool, and (3) DSMM as a market intelligence source. In both academic research to date and corresponding practitioner discussion, there is much to appreciate. However, there are also several shortcomings of extant research that have limited its relevance and created points of disconnect between academia and practice. Finally, in light of this, an agenda for future research based on emerging research topics is advanced.

502,"Marketing departments are under increased pressure to demonstrate their economic value to the firm. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that marketing uses attitudinal (e.g., brand awareness), behavioral (e.g., brand loyalty), and financial (e.g., sales revenue) performance metrics, which do not correlate highly with each other. Thus, one metric could view marketing initiatives as successful, whereas another could interpret them as a waste of resources. The resulting ambiguity has several consequences for marketing practice. Among these are that the scope and objectives of marketing differ widely across organizations. There is confusion about the difference between marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Hard and soft metrics and offline and online metrics are typically not integrated. The two dominant tools for marketing impact assessment, response models and experiments, are rarely combined. Risk in marketing planning and execution receives little consideration, and analytic insights are not communicated effectively to drive decisions. The authors first examine how these factors affect both research and practice. They then discuss how the use of marketing analytics can improve marketing decision making at different levels of the organization. The authors identify gaps in marketing's knowledge base that set the stage for further research and enhanced practice in demonstrating marketing's value.

503,"Category management (CM) has become a widespread trade practice in recent years. A category manager's decision problem is complex and multifaceted owing to demand dependencies across products and across time. Extant research on CM has typically focused on one or the other of these dependencies, but seldom both. The authors address this research gap by presenting a competition framework that reconciles cross-sectional breadth (large numbers of stockkeeping units in any given period) with longitudinal depth (demand effects across time). The endeavor is to offer retailers a general, realistic, and practical CM approach by comprehensively accounting for competitive effects. The authors demonstrate their approach using real-world data in the beer category for a midsize grocery chain in the northeastern United States. After determining the optimal weekly prices for the entire assortment over 23 weeks, the authors report a profit yield that is 3.30% more than in the benchmark logit model and substantially more than in the retailer's current everyday low price policy.

504,"The growth of subscription-based commerce has changed the types of data that firms report to external shareholders. More than ever, companies are discussing and disclosing information on the number of customers acquired and lost, customer lifetime value, and other data. This has fueled an increasing interest in linking the value of a firm's customers to the overall value of the firm, with the term “customer-based corporate valuation” being used to describe such efforts. Although several researchers in the fields of marketing and accounting have explored this idea, their underlying models of customer acquisition and retention do not adequately reflect the empirical realities associated with these behaviors, and the associated valuation models do not meet the standards of finance professionals. The authors develop a framework for valuing subscription-based firms that addresses both issues, and they apply it to data from DISH Network and Sirius XM Holdings.

505,"Although marketers increasingly rely on customer data, firms have little insight into the ramifications of such data use and do not know how to prevent negative effects. Data management efforts may heighten customers’ vulnerability worries or create real vulnerability. Using a conceptual framework grounded in gossip theory, the authors link customer vulnerability to negative performance effects. Three studies show that transparency and control in firms’ data management practices can suppress the negative effects of customer data vulnerability. Experimental manipulations reveal that mere access to personal data inflates feelings of violation and reduces trust. An event study of data security breaches affecting 414 public companies also confirms negative effects, as well as spillover vulnerabilities from rival firms’ breaches, on firm performance. Severity of the breach hurts the focal firm but helps the rival firm, which provides some insight into mixed findings in prior research. Finally, a field study with actual customers of 15 companies across three industries demonstrates consistent effects across four types of customer data vulnerability and confirms that violation and trust mediate the effects of data vulnerabilities on outcomes.

506,"This article examines whether and how a company's division of segment- and task-related responsibilities among multiple sales channels affects the relationships in the multichannel (MC) system and, ultimately, the company's sales success. Building on open systems theory, the authors develop an overarching framework of organizational MC differentiation that distinguishes between two generic approaches: segment differentiation and task differentiation. They predict that these two approaches affect key relationship and performance outcomes of an MC system, but do so differently and contingent on key characteristics of the company's customers. Drawing on a multi-informant survey in a business-to-business context as well as on objective performance data, the authors find that segment differentiation tends to mitigate horizontal conflict and inhibit cooperation, while task differentiation reduces primarily vertical conflict and promotes cooperation. Moreover, depending on customer characteristics, segment differentiation may damage channel relationships overall and, in turn, limit company sales success, whereas task differentiation unambiguously promotes channel relationships and thus drives company sales success. These findings offer novel insights into the relationship and performance impact of MC systems’ organizational structure and provide useful guidance on how managers should allocate segment- and task-related responsibilities among multiple sales channels.

507,"A product's physical appearance is difficult to quantify, and the impact of product appearance on demand has rarely been studied using market data. The authors adopt a recently developed morphing technique to measure a product's aesthetic design and investigate its effect on consumer preference. Drawing upon categorization theory, the authors consider the effects of three dimensions of aesthetic design—segment prototypicality (SP), brand consistency (BC), and cross-segment mimicry (CSM)—and their moderating effects on marketing mix effectiveness in a unified framework. The empirical analysis uses a unique, large data set consisting of 202 car models from 33 brands sold in the United States from 2003 to 2010. The authors find that consumer preference peaks at moderate levels of SP and BC and that economy-segment products benefit from CSM of luxury products. Moreover, SP intensifies price sensitivity, and BC muffles price sensitivity while increasing advertising effectiveness. Two what-if studies illustrate how managers can use the empirical model to evaluate alternative aesthetic design choices.
",We examine the impact of product differentiation on consumer choice in a consumer-centric setting. We use a unique data set of consumer-centric products to examine the impact of product differentiation on consumer choice. We find that product differentiation affects consumer choice by increasing the likelihood of choosing a product that is perceived as superior to the product that is perceived as inferior. We find that product differentiation increases consumer choice by increasing the likelihood of choosing a product that is perceived as superior to the product that is perceived as inferior. We also find that product differentiation increases consumer choice by increasing the likelihood of choosing a product that is perceived as superior to the product that is perceived as inferior. We find that product differentiation increases consumer choice by increasing the likelihood of choosing a product that is perceived as superior to the product that is perceived as inferior. We also find that product differentiation increases consumer choice by increasing the likelihood of choosing a product that is perceived as superior to the product that is perceived as inferior.

508,"This research examines how consumers make trade-offs between highly competent, less moral service providers and highly moral, less competent service providers. Counter to research on general impression formation, which shows that moral traits dominate competence traits, the authors demonstrate that when choosing between service providers, consumers systematically value competence more than morality. However, underdog positioning moderates this effect. When a moral service provider is positioned as an underdog, consumers feel empathy, thereby attenuating the dominance of competence. Notably, although underdog positioning can help a moral provider overcome a deficit in competence, it does not help a competent service provider overcome a deficit in morality or a warm provider overcome a deficit in competence. Thus, underdog positioning is particularly well suited for less competent service providers who are highly moral.
","We examine how firms can benefit from a firm's ability to compete with other firms in a market where competition is low. We find that firms with low competitiveness are more likely to compete with other firms in a market where competition is high. However, firms with high competitiveness are more likely to compete with other firms in a market where competition is low. We also find that firms with low competitiveness are more likely to compete with other firms in a market where competition is low. This is because firms with low competitiveness are more likely to compete with other firms in a market where competition is low. This is because firms with low competitiveness are more likely to compete with other firms in a market where competition is low.  We also find that firms with low competitiveness are more likely to compete with other firms in a market where competition is low.

509,"The days of dominant manufacturers dictating the game to obedient retailers are long gone. When parties believe they have equal bargaining power, negotiations end in deadlock more frequently and result in conflict delistings wherein the manufacturers’ brands get removed from the retailers’ assortments. This might cause major sales losses as consumers are forced to change stores or brands. The authors study both parties’ vulnerabilities by investigating their market share shifts during a highly publicized real-life conflict delisting executed by a major retailer against a major manufacturer, involving multiple brands and categories. Generally, both parties lost sales, yet the retailer was the most vulnerable party. Manufacturer-brand and retailer-assortment characteristics moderated both parties’ vulnerability: the manufacturer and retailer became respectively less and more vulnerable when a high-equity brand was delisted in a small assortment. Both parties lost more in necessity than in impulse categories. The authors additionally investigate long-term consequences that occurred after the conflict was settled: the retailer's market share recovered to the predelisting level, whereas the manufacturer's share underwent a long-term level rise.

510,"This study examines customization as a coordination problem in transactions with business customers. Marketing research has investigated challenges associated with customized offers from the customer side; however, scant research has examined the supplier's challenges and their performance implications. The authors distinguish between project revenues and costs to reveal a fundamental dilemma that suppliers face during customization. Analyses of dyadic survey data collected from a software supplier and its business customers, as well as objective revenue and cost data, reveal a tension between project revenues and costs. The outcomes of customization depend on factors that relieve the coordination problem, such as customer demand ambiguity, customer participation, product modularity, project team technological capability, and relational embeddedness. These findings provide a basis to assess the value of customization as a tool to implement a customer-oriented business-to-business marketing strategy.

511,"This research examines the effect of gamified information presentation—conveying information about a product innovation in the form of a game—on consumer adoption of that innovation. The key hypothesis is that gamified information presentation promotes consumer innovation adoption and that it does so through two parallel psychological processes—by increasing consumer playfulness, which stimulates curiosity about the innovation, and by enhancing the perceived vividness of information presentation, which increases the perceived advantage of the innovation relative to (less innovative) competing products. Evidence from seven studies, including two field experiments, supports this theorizing. The results also show that for gamified information presentation to increase innovation adoption, it is essential that the information is integrated into the game. These findings advance the understanding of the psychological forces that govern how consumers respond to receiving product information in the form of games, and they have important practical implications for how firms might use gamified information presentation to promote sales of new products.

512,"When a sales representative (rep) leaves a business-to-business firm, a crucial link with the rep's customers becomes severed. The firm reassigns those customers to different sales reps (either existing reps or new hires) in a manner that mitigates potential sales losses. What causal effect do sales rep departures have on customer-level revenue, and which sales rep replacement strategies are more effective? Using data from a Fortune 500 firm and a difference-in-differences analysis with correction for selection bias, the authors show that sales rep transitions lead to 13.2%–17.6% losses in annual sales. New hires are less effective than existing sales reps in mitigating sales losses. Existing sales reps who are similar (vs. dissimilar) to the departing reps (in terms of past industry experience) are more effective in mitigating sales losses; however, reps with high past performance do not exhibit greater efficacy for mitigating sales losses than reps with average or low past performance. The analysis presents means to quantify the economic consequences of losing a sales rep and to determine how to reassign customers to sales reps according to the resulting economic impact.

513,"Media content distribution has changed extensively in the past decade. Content that was once distributed through traditional formats such as television, radio, and print is now available through contemporary digital formats such as smartphone and tablet apps, with many possible versions (e.g., presence or absence of ads). Consequently, many media firms that face heterogeneous markets of consumers with varying content consumption preferences are now offering “menus” of multiformat and multiversion subscription bundles for their customers to choose from. Yet, little systematic model-based guidance exists for configuring and pricing menu options. Moreover, most media firms are audience-building platforms that serve at least two distinct customer groups (content consumers and advertisers) with interrelated demands. Therefore, constructing a menu of content subscription bundles that maximizes total profit from both consumers and advertisers is a formidable challenge. This research proposes a theory-driven implementable model-based approach that can aid media platforms in addressing this challenge. The proposed approach is then demonstrated for a U.S. newspaper, and insights into profit-maximizing menus under various business model and format strategies are provided.

514,"Firms routinely use press releases to announce the launch of their new products. An examination of these press releases shows that in approximately 7% of cases, firms issue new product announcements concurrently with other corporate announcements. However, the consequences of these actions are unknown because event studies typically eliminate concurrent announcements in an attempt to avoid their confounding effects. The authors use a comprehensive sample of press releases issued by publicly traded U.S. firms to document the consequences of firms announcing the release of a new product concurrently with another corporate announcement that conveys good news. Drawing on Merton's (1987) model of capital market equilibrium with incomplete information, the authors identify three conditions that are conducive to the issuance of concurrent new product announcements. They then verify that under these conditions, the increase in shareholder value associated with concurrent announcements is higher than that associated with issuing two similar announcements separately. This research provides insights into how firms can leverage corporate communications to increase stock prices.

515,"This research examines the effects of warning messages that emphasize the social consequences of negative health outcomes. The authors demonstrate that highlighting social (vs. health) consequences leads to greater perceived temporal proximity of and increased perceived vulnerability to the outcome, thereby affecting risk perceptions, behavioral intentions, and customer perceptions of actual experience. They document this effect across five studies in different health domains including flossing (Study 1), soda consumption (Study 2), smoking (Study 3), and unprotected ultraviolet light exposure (Studies 4 and 5). These findings point to the important role of the consequence type highlighted in warning messages, which can have a significant impact on risk perceptions and consumer experiences.

516,"Steady customer losses create pressure for firms to acquire new accounts, a task that is both costly and risky. Lacking knowledge about their prospects, firms often use a large array of predictors obtained from list vendors, which in turn rapidly creates massive high-dimensional data problems. Selecting the appropriate variables and their functional relationships with acquisition probabilities is therefore a substantial challenge. This study proposes a Bayesian variable selection approach to optimally select targets for new customer acquisition. Data from an insurance company reveal that this approach outperforms nonselection methods and selection methods based on expert judgment as well as benchmarks based on principal component analysis and bootstrap aggregation of classification trees. Notably, the optimal results show that the Bayesian approach selects panel-based metrics as predictors, detects several nonlinear relationships, selects very large numbers of addresses, and generates profits. In a series of post hoc analyses, the authors consider prospects’ response behaviors and cross-selling potential and systematically vary the number of predictors and the estimated profit per response. The results reveal that more predictors and higher response rates do not necessarily lead to higher profits.

517,"Given that consumers value quality, and advertising content informs consumers’ beliefs about quality, it is not surprising that high-quality brands emphasize quality in their advertising content. What is less obvious is whether firms with lower-quality brands should also follow suit and emphasize quality in their advertising to signal a higher quality. We examine this issue and study the effectiveness of quality-based advertising messages. Our field study relates brands’ monthly sales to their advertised quality claims across 1,876 print ads in national magazines and Consumer Reports–based product quality ratings over more than two decades. Contrary to the generally held yet erroneous belief in the efficacy of low-quality products emphasizing quality in their advertising, we demonstrate that (1) it is not beneficial for a low-quality firm to emphasize quality in its advertising, and (2) it is effective for a high-quality firm to do so. An analysis of parameter values from a published category-agnostic simulation and an experiment that examines consumers’ responses to quality claims in a second product category yields convergent insights.

518,"Group marketing uses the psychological mechanisms underlying group influence to drive customer behaviors that are beneficial to the firm. It is predicated on the firm's ability to guide two necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) a customer's awareness of an affiliation with the focal group and (2) exposure to group norms. By examining what it means to be affiliated with a group; determining how group norms are inferred, applied, and maintained; and testing a wide variety of ways in which these conditions become manifest, this research demonstrates the theoretical foundations of group marketing. Groups influence purchase behaviors by altering information and identity appraisals during decision making. Time in a purchase domain emerges as a critical determinant of the strength of group influence. Although previous research has suggested that social influence diminishes over time, a longitudinal field study and an experiment reveal that this prediction holds only when information appraisal dominates; an opposite effect arises when identity appraisal dominates. Group efficacy strengthens, but product price weakens, the effects of groups on purchase behaviors.

519,"Firms may allocate scarce resources to two fundamental strategic processes: value creation and value appropriation. The relative investment in these processes (i.e., a firm's relative strategic emphasis) may be associated with firm-idiosyncratic risk. Empirically, a firm's relative strategic emphasis is represented by the difference between its advertising expenditure and its research-and-development expenditure. Using data from 2,403 firms over the period of 2000–2014, the authors find that firms’ relative strategic emphasis on value appropriation versus value creation reduces firm risk, though in a contingent manner. This association is weaker when firms have larger positive or negative relative performance. Furthermore, these contingent associations are stronger when demand instability in an industry is higher. Overall, the results demonstrate that a firm's strategic emphasis should be examined in light of its relative performance, as well as in the context of current market conditions, when making judicious resource allocation decisions.

520,"Firms are increasingly offering engagement initiatives to facilitate firm–customer interactions or interactions among customers, with the primary goal of fostering emotional and psychological bonds between customers and the firm. Unlike traditional marketing interventions, which are designed to prompt sales, assessing returns on engagement initiatives (RoEI) is more complex because sales are not the primary goal and, often, direct sales are not associated with such initiatives. To assess RoEI across varying institutional contexts, the authors propose and empirically implement a methodological framework to investigate a business-to-business mobile app that a tool manufacturer provides for free to engage its buyers. The data include sales by buyer firms that adopted the app over 15 months, as well as a control group of buyers that did not adopt. The results from a difference-in-differences specification, together with selection on observables and unobservables, show that the app increased the manufacturer's annual sales revenues by 19.11%–22.79%; even after accounting for development costs, it resulted in positive RoEI. This RoEI was higher when buyers created more projects using the app, so customer participation intensity appears to underlie RoEI. This article contributes to engagement literature by providing a methodological framework and empirical evidence on how the benefits of engagement initiatives materialize.

521,"The business model for musicians relies on selling recorded music and selling concert tickets. Traditionally, demand for one format (e.g., concerts) would stimulate demand for the other format (e.g., recorded music) and vice versa, leading to an upward demand spiral. However, the market for recorded music is under pressure due to piracy and the unbundling of albums, which also entail threats for the traditional demand spiral. Despite the fundamental importance of recorded music and live concerts for the multibillion-dollar music industry, no prior research has studied their dynamic interplay. This study fills this void by developing new theory on how piracy, unbundling, artist fame, and music quality affect dynamic cross-format elasticities between record demand and concert demand. The theory is tested with a unique data set covering weekly concert and recorded music revenues for close to 400 artists across more than six years in the world's third-largest music market, Germany. The cross-format elasticity of record on concert revenue is much stronger than the reverse elasticity of concert on record revenue. The results show the key role of piracy, unbundling, and artist characteristics on these cross-format elasticities, which have implications for the business model of the music industry.

522,"Social tags are user-defined keywords associated with online content that reflect consumers’ perceptions of various objects, including products and brands. This research presents a new approach for harvesting rich, qualitative information on brands from user-generated social tags. The authors first compare their proposed approach with conventional techniques such as brand concept maps and text mining. They highlight the added value of their approach that results from the unconstrained, open-ended, and synoptic nature of consumer-generated content contained within social tags. The authors then apply existing text-mining and data-reduction methods to analyze disaggregate-level social tagging data for marketing research and demonstrate how marketers can utilize the information in social tags by extracting key representative topics, monitoring common dynamic trends, and understanding heterogeneous perceptions of a brand.

523,"Building on results from economics and consumer behavior, the authors theorize that consumers’ movement patterns are informative of their product preferences, and this study proposes that marketers monetize this information using dynamic networks that capture colocation events (when consumers appear at the same place at approximately the same time). To support this theory, the authors study mobile advertising response in a panel of 217 subscribers. The data set spans three months during which participants were sent mobile coupons from retailers in various product categories through a smartphone application. The data contain coupon conversions, demographic and psychographic information, and information on the hourly GPS location of participants and on their social ties in the form of referrals. The authors find a significant positive relationship between colocated consumers’ response to coupons in the same product category. In addition, they show that incorporating consumers’ location information can increase the accuracy of predicting the most likely conversions by 19%. These findings have important practical implications for marketers engaging in the fast-growing location-based mobile advertising industry.

524,"Category captainship (CC) is a retailing practice wherein a retailer collaborates with one of the manufacturers in a product category (referred to as the captain) to develop and implement a category management strategy. Although CC has been studied using both theoretical models and surveys, empirical evidence on the benefits and drawbacks of CC is scarce. The authors use a unique data set collected during a CC implementation to empirically examine the impact of CC on the retailer, the captain, and the other manufacturers in the category. The authors find that both the retailer's private label and the captain benefit from CC because of pricing and assortment changes. They also find that some competing manufacturers benefit from CC while others suffer. Specifically, the manufacturers that closely compete with the captain benefit, whereas the manufacturers that are in close competition with the private label suffer because the retailer protects its private label. The authors show that category sales would have been higher if the retailer had not protected its private label.

525,"Salespeople play a crucial role in their firms’ efforts to provide customer solutions. However, little research has examined how salesperson involvement in customer solutions can be conceptualized, whether it pays off, and what boundary conditions might heighten its performance effects. This study addresses these gaps and offers a conceptualization of salesperson solution involvement by focusing on the set of salesperson-related activities that enact the four relational processes inherent in customer solutions. The authors collect a unique data set that includes a wide range of firms, industries, and countries, as well as the perspectives of both salespeople and customers, across five studies. Results validate the stability of the conceptualization across contexts. They also reveal that salesperson solution involvement is systematically related to increases in both subjective and objective, time-lagged measures of sales performance. Finally, results show that the performance effects of salesperson solution involvement are amplified under higher levels of firm's product portfolio scope, sales unit cross-functional cooperation, and customer–supplier relationship tie strength. Surprisingly, customer adaptiveness is not found to moderate the performance effects of salesperson solution involvement.
","We examine how firms’ performance in the context of a multiyear supply chain affects the performance of their suppliers. We develop a model of supplier performance that incorporates the dynamics of supplier-supplier relationships and the dynamics of supplier-supplier relationships in a multistage supply chain. We find that supplier performance is positively related to supplier-supplier relationships, and supplier performance is positively related to supplier-supplier relationships in a multistage supply chain. We also find that supplier performance is positively related to supplier-supplier relationships in a multistage supply chain. We also find that supplier performance is positively related to supplier-supplier relationships in a multistage supply chain. We discuss the implications of these findings for the management of supplier-supplier relationships and the management of supplier-supplier relationships in a multistage supply chain. We discuss the implications of these findings for the management of supplier-supplier relationships and the management of supplier-supplier relationships in a multistage supply chain.This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.

526,"This study examines the relative effectiveness of traditional advertising, impressions generated through firm-to-consumer (F2C) messages on Facebook, and the volume and valence of consumer-to-consumer (C2C) messages on Twitter and web forums for brand-building and customer acquisition efforts. The authors apply vector autoregressive modeling to a unique data set from a European telecom firm. This modeling approach allows them to consider the interrelations among traditional advertising, F2C impressions, and volume and valence of C2C social messages. The results show that traditional advertising is most effective for both brand building and customer acquisition. Impressions generated through F2C social messages complement traditional advertising efforts. Thus, thoroughly orchestrating traditional advertising and a firm's social media activities may improve a firm's performance with respect to building the brand and encouraging customer acquisition. Moreover, firms can stimulate the volume and valence of C2C messages through traditional advertising that in turn influences brand building and acquisition. These findings can help managers leverage the different types of messages more adequately.
",We investigate the impact of customer-generated content on the firm's revenue and profitability. We use a unique data set of sales data from a leading online retailer to examine the impact of customer-generated content on sales and profitability. We find that customer-generated content increases sales by approximately 10% and profitability by approximately 10% in the presence of customer-generated content. We also find that customer-generated content increases sales by approximately 10% in the presence of customer-generated content. We also find that customer-generated content increases sales by approximately 10% in the presence of customer-generated content. We also find that customer-generated content increases sales by approximately 10% in the presence of customer-generated content. We also find that customer-generated content increases sales by approximately 10% in the presence of customer-generated content.

527,"The authors propose a model relating a product's comparative price to the construal level of its associated communications and show how perceived expensiveness shapes consumers’ response to the wording of marketing communications. A series of six studies shows that for both absolute low- and high-cost product categories, comparatively expensive (inexpensive) products are preferred when accompanied by high-construal (low-construal) messages, due to the conceptual fluency of the “match” between price-induced psychological distance and construal level. The model provides novel implications for designing effective marketing communications: comparatively expensive versions of objectively low-priced products (e.g., an expensive chocolate truffle) are best promoted through more abstract slogans, whereas comparatively affordable versions of objectively high-priced products (e.g., an inexpensive diamond pendant) are best promoted using more concrete slogans. By emphasizing the link between comparative price and the matching level of construal, the authors contribute to a richer view of the interplay between price and product communication in marketing.
","We study the impact of a “price-tagging” (tagging) on the purchase of a product in a retail outlet. We find that the price tag is associated with a higher purchase likelihood of a product, and the price tag is associated with a lower purchase likelihood of a product. The effect of price tag on purchase likelihood is stronger for products with a higher price tag, and the effect of price tag on purchase likelihood is stronger for products with a lower price tag. The effect of price tag on purchase likelihood is stronger for products with a higher price tag, and the effect of price tag on purchase likelihood is stronger for products with a lower price tag. The results of the literature on price tag and price tag-related product characteristics are consistent with the hypothesis that price tag is associated with higher purchase likelihood, and price tag is associated with lower purchase likelihood. The results of the literature on price tag and price tag-related product characteristics are consistent with the hypothesis that price tag is associated with higher purchase likelihood, and price tag is associated with lower purchase likelihood.

528,"Companies increasingly face product harm crises resulting in product recalls, which often have a negative impact on firm value. Whereas prior research has studied the short-term effects of product recalls on firm value, the authors of this article focus on the long-term effects. They develop a conceptual framework and hypotheses about the main effect of recall volume and the moderating effects of crisis management strategies on the relationship between recall volume and long-term firm value. They empirically test the hypotheses in the auto industry context using both short-term abnormal returns analysis and long-term calendar-time portfolio analysis of 280 product recalls during 2005–2015. The findings reveal that the negative impact of product recall volume lingers over time. Brand (promotion) advertising has a significant positive (negative) effect on the relationship between recall volume and long-term abnormal returns. Furthermore, both voluntary recall initiation and postrecall remedial efforts positively moderate the impact of recall volume on long-term returns. These moderating effects are contrary to those in the short term. The results suggest that managers should use different advertising types during and after a recall, strategically initiate recalls, and diligently prepare postrecall remedies to mitigate the negative effects of recall volume on long-term return.

529,"Geographic proximity has become increasingly relevant due to the growing number of marketing services that use consumers’ geographic locations, thus increasing the importance of gaining insights from this information. In five studies (both field and experimental), the authors analyze the effect of geographic proximity on social influence and demonstrate that not only social proximity but also perceived homophily can trigger social influence. They find that this effect holds under alternative representations of geographic distance and is confirmed for a range of different services and even for physical goods. Furthermore, the authors show that geographic proximity has a relative effect because the social influence of a closer sender is stronger than that of a more distant sender, regardless of the absolute distances. They present managerially relevant conditions under which the influence of geographic proximity not only is comparable to other types of information such as age or gender but also provides sufficient informational value for customers to offset differences among alternatives (e.g., due to higher prices) in trade-off decisions.

530,"Although a large body of research has investigated how consumers use goods to signal their status, little is known about how brands manage status. The very few studies that have examined this topic are grounded in the traditional conception of status and focus on the possession and display of status signals. The authors offer an alternative understanding of status management by investigating the role of interactions in the service encounter. Drawing from extensive ethnographic work in luxury stores, they investigate how brands (re)configure the status games that surface in the service encounter. They show that through the material and social cues of the servicescape, brands shape consumers’ class subjectivities—that is, they make consumers behave as class subjects who have a specific understanding of their position in the social hierarchy. Thus, managing status requires the active creation and management of consumers as class subjects. There is a shift from managing branded goods that signal status to managing customer experiences that make consumers enact status positions. This research helps identify new ways to manage status brands, especially luxury brands.

531,"Many goods manufacturers and service providers jointly deliver partnered hybrid offerings to achieve competitive advantage and superior performance. In such cases, service providers may emphasize different aspects of service in their offerings. Do service providers and goods manufacturers benefit equally from emphasizing service satisfaction? Do the performance effects of emphases on different aspects of service satisfaction vary across different goods? The authors examine the effects of emphases on two aspects of service satisfaction, relational service (interactions with the service provider's staff) and service environment (service provider's facilities), on the market shares of service and goods components of partnered hybrid offerings. Using multiple secondary data sources from the U.S. automobile industry between 2009 and 2015, the authors find that emphasizing relational service satisfaction increases service market share but decreases goods market share. Counterintuitively, emphasizing service environment satisfaction decreases service market share. Furthermore, the vertical quality of the good moderates these relationships. The findings generate actionable guidelines to improve market shares by adjusting relational service satisfaction and service environment satisfaction in the partnered hybrid offerings context.

532,"Nonprofit firms’ reliance on donations to build inventory distinguishes them from traditional retailers. This reliance on consumer donations means that these organizations face an inherently more volatile supply chain than retailers that source inventory from manufacturers. The authors propose that consumer reluctance to part with possessions with sentimental value causes a bottleneck in the donation process. The goal of this research is therefore to provide nonprofits with tools to increase donations of used goods and provide a theoretical link between the literature streams on prosocial behavior, disposition, memory, and identity. As such, the authors explore the effectiveness of memory preservation strategies (e.g., taking a photo of a good before donating it) in increasing donations to nonprofits. A field study using a donation drive demonstrates that encouraging consumers to take photos of sentimental possessions before donating them increases donations, and five laboratory experiments explicate this result by mapping the proposed psychological process behind the success of memory preservation techniques. Specifically, these techniques operate by ameliorating consumers’ perceived identity loss when considering donation of sentimental goods.

533,"Sponsoring joins brands with sports, the arts, and events in mutually beneficial partnerships. In the context of sports, the authors examine how sponsorship deal characteristics affect consumer inferences, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward a sponsor and a sport property in a partnership. The authors develop a conceptual framework that links a holistic set of sponsorship deal characteristics (i.e., contract length, regional proximity of the sponsor, sponsorship fee, and sponsorship type) to individual consumer perceptions. Study 1 tests the framework in a field study of 2,787 consumers across 44 sponsorships. Study 2 largely confirms the findings of the field study in an experimental study. Overall, the results show that regionally proximate and long-term partnerships benefit as consumers make positive inferences about partnership fit and sponsor motives. In contrast, consumers associate high sponsorship fees, international sponsors, and naming-rights relationships with calculative motives and perceive these factors negatively. For managers, finding that sponsorship deal characteristics matter is important not only for sponsor–property relationships but also for relationships between the sponsoring brands and consumers.

534,"This article examines the impact of new product development (NPD) “make/buy” choices on product quality using data from the automobile industry. Although the business press has lamented that NPD outsourcing compromises product quality, there is no systematic evidence to support or refute this assertion. Against this backdrop, this study tests a contingency model of the impact of NPD make/buy decisions on immediate and future product quality. The hypotheses are tested using data on NPD make/buy choices of 173 models of 12 automobile firms in the United States between 2007 and 2014. The authors find that whereas NPD buy has a more positive impact on immediate product quality, NPD make has a more positive impact on future product quality. Furthermore, the immediate product quality impact of NPD buy is stronger when (1) technologies are more complex and (2) firm NPD capability is higher. In contrast, the future product quality impact of NPD make is stronger when (1) there is postlaunch adverse feedback and (2) firm NPD capability is higher. The study highlights the complex trade-offs associated with NPD make/buy decisions and offers valuable insights on how firms could manage these decisions.

535,"As social network use continues to increase, an important question for marketers is whether consumers’ online shopping activities are related to their use of social networks and, if so, what the nature of this relationship is. On the one hand, spending time on social networks could facilitate social discovery, meaning that consumers “discover” or “stumble upon” products through their connections with others. Moreover, cumulative social network use could expose consumers to new shopping-related information, possibly with greater marginal value than the incremental time spent on a shopping website. This process may therefore be associated with increased shopping activity. On the other hand, social network use could be a substitute for other online activities, including shopping. To test the relationship between social network use and online shopping, the authors leverage a unique consumer panel data set that tracks people's browsing of shopping and social network websites and their online purchasing activities over one year. The authors find that greater cumulative usage of social networking sites is positively associated with shopping activity. However, they also find a short-term negative relationship, such that immediately after a period of increased usage of social networking sites, online shopping activity appears to be lower.

536,"Using the notion of customer concentration, the authors argue that firms should evenly spread their revenues across their customers, rather than focusing on a few major customer relationships. Prior literature suggests that major customers improve efficiency and provide access to resources, thereby producing positive performance outcomes. However, building on industrial organizational literature and modern portfolio theory, the authors argue that concentration of revenues reduces the supplier firm's bargaining power relative to its customers and hurts the ability of the supplier firm to appropriate value, which, in turn, hurts profits. Using a sample of 1,023 initial public offerings (IPOs) and robust econometric methods, they find that customer concentration reduces investor uncertainty and positively impacts IPO outcomes, but significantly hurts balance sheet–based outcomes (e.g., profitability). The results suggest that a 10% increase in customer concentration reduces profitability by 3.35% (or about $7 million) in the subsequent year, or 9.4% cumulatively over the next four years (or about $20.32 million). Further, the authors find that the negative effects of customer concentration decrease with increase in organizational (marketing, technological, and operational) capabilities and increase with low customer credit quality.

537,"The mobile application (app) industry has grown tremendously over the past ten years, primarily fueled by small app development businesses. Lacking advertising budgets, these small and relatively unknown businesses often offer free versions of their paid apps to be noticed in the crowded app industry and to reduce customer uncertainty about app quality and fit. The authors build on the existing marketing and information systems literature on sampling and versioning to investigate the implications of offering free versions for the adoption speed of paid apps. Using a unique data set of 7.7 million observations from 12,315 paid apps, and accounting for endogeneity, the authors find that although the practice of offering free versions of paid apps is popular, it is negatively associated with paid app adoption speed. They also find that this negative association between free version presence and paid app adoption speed is stronger both for hedonic apps and in the later life stages of paid apps. The authors hope that the study's results will encourage app developers to reevaluate their current strategy of offering free versions of paid apps and prompt academics to produce more work focusing on this industry.

538,"Service firms spend considerable resources soliciting complaints to initiate recovery efforts and improve their offerings. However, managers may be overlooking the fact that complaints serve an equally important role in engendering loyalty. The authors demonstrate that the strength of social ties between customers and service providers influences the degree to which complaining drives loyalty. Paradoxically, while strongly tied customers fear that complaining threatens their ties with the provider, when they are encouraged to complain, their loyalty increases because offering feedback serves as an effective way to preserve social ties. Conversely, for weakly tied customers, complaining has no effect on loyalty. Furthermore, complaints are more effective in driving loyalty for strongly tied customers when the feedback is directed toward the provider who failed, rather than to an entity external to the failure. Finally, when providers signal an authentic openness to feedback, strongly tied customers are more loyal after complaining, whereas authenticity does little to engender loyalty for weakly tied customers who complain. The value of complaints in driving loyalty is promising both for customers who perceive a strong tie to a particular provider within the firm and, more generally, in service industries wherein strong ties naturally occur.

539,"Anthropomorphizing a brand (i.e., imbuing a brand with humanlike features) serves as an important brand positioning strategy for marketing managers. This research identifies a key brand anthropomorphization strategy—positioning a brand as either oriented to interact with consumers or not. Managers generally rely on this brand interaction strategy to enhance consumer brand engagement regardless of the social context. However, given that consumers often experience brands in a social context, this research demonstrates that social crowdedness moderates the positive impact of interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands on consumer brand preferences. Specifically, the authors show that consumers’ inferences of an anthropomorphized brand's intentionality to interact with them in a socially crowded context trigger greater social withdrawal, thereby resulting in lower preferences for the brand. The authors further demonstrate that the core negative effect of social crowdedness is contingent on the type of crowding (goal-related vs. goal-unrelated). In particular, a goal-related crowding decreases social withdrawal reactions, which, in turn, leads to greater preferences for interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands relative to brands with other positioning strategies. In contrast, the effect of social crowdedness on consumer preferences for interaction-oriented anthropomorphized brands remains negative in goal-unrelated crowded settings.

540,"Introducing customers to new ideas lies at the heart of marketing, yet surprisingly little is known about customers’ state of inspiration within this domain. This article reviews prior conceptualizations of general inspiration in psychology and introduces the concept of customer inspiration as a customer's temporary motivational state that facilitates the transition from the reception of a marketing-induced idea to the intrinsic pursuit of a consumption-related goal. The authors develop and validate a two-state, ten-item customer inspiration scale that consists of inspired-by and inspired-to states. The scale development process begins with item generation, followed by five studies: (1) scale purification and initial validation, (2) exploration of the nomological network, (3) tests for the experimental and predictive validity, (4) replication within a field experiment, and (5) assessments of generalizability and boundary conditions. Empirical results reveal sound psychometric properties of the scale, demonstrate its unique position in relation to established marketing constructs, and support experimental and predictive validity. Applying the scale in marketing practice offers a new way for firms to increase demand, motivate customers’ exploration behavior, and build customer loyalty.
","We propose a novel model of customer acquisition and customer engagement that integrates the two dimensions of customer acquisition and customer engagement. The model is based on a longitudinal data set of 1,919 customer acquisition and customer engagement experiences from a leading online retailer. The model is tested on a sample of 1,919 customer acquisition experiences from a leading online retailer. The results show that customer acquisition and customer engagement are positively related to the likelihood of a purchase, and that the likelihood of a purchase is positively related to the likelihood of a purchase. The model also predicts that customer acquisition and customer engagement are positively related to the likelihood of a purchase, and that the likelihood of a purchase is positively related to the likelihood of a purchase.

541,"Although it seems intuitive for firms to leverage social connections and interactions to influence consumers’ goal attainment and spending, the authors present a caveat of such strategies. Using two large-scale data sets with more than 5 million people-day observations from online gaming markets, Studies 1 and 2 show consistently nonlinear effects. Although some social connections and interactions boost goal attainment and spending (positive linear term), after a certain point too many of them have a diminished marginal effect (negative squared term). The results are robust to a wide array of modeling techniques addressing self-selection, unobserved individual heterogeneity, and endogeneity. In addition, novices can benefit more from greater social connections and interactions, yet also suffer more from the diminishing effects. Regarding the underlying mechanism, the follow-up experiment Study 3 shows that consistent with the information processing theory, some social connections and interactions can provide information support for goal attainment, but too many of them can introduce an information overload problem and, thus, hamper goal attainment intention. Together, these findings refute a simple, linear view of the effects of social connections and interactions and provide pivotal theoretical and practical implications.
","We study the effects of social network effects on the performance of social network users. We propose a novel framework to study the effects of social network effects on social network users’ performance. We propose that social network effects are associated with a positive social network effect, whereas social network effects are associated with a negative social network effect. We find that social network effects are associated with a positive social network effect, whereas social network effects are associated with a negative social network effect. We also find that social network effects are associated with a positive social network effect, whereas social network effects are associated with a negative social network effect.

542,"Customer value refers to the economic value of the customer's relationship with the firm. This study approaches the topic of customer value for measuring, managing, and maximizing customer contributions by proposing a customer valuation theory (CVT) based on economic principles that conceptualizes the generation of value from customers to firms. The author reviews the established economic theories for valuing investor assets (e.g., stocks) and draws a comparison to valuing customer contributions. Furthermore, the author recognizes the differences in the guiding principles between valuing stocks and valuing customers in proposing CVT. Using CVT, the author discusses the concept of customer lifetime value (CLV) as the metric that can provide a reliable, forward-looking estimate of direct customer value. In addition, economic models to estimate CLV, ways to manage CLV using portfolio management principles, and strategies to maximize CLV are discussed in detail. The author extends the customer value concept by discussing ways that a customer can add value to the firm indirectly through incentivized referrals, social media influence, and feedback. Finally, the benefits of CVT to multiple constituencies are offered.
",We develop a model of customer acquisition and customer value that incorporates the value of customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a function of the customer value as a,-0.6289879,-0.49799353,-1.9354163,0.0363683,-0.40724686,-0.62360454,-1.4468316,0.8887977,-0.19150317,0.19304807,0.042588547,0.77522016,0.7793308,-0.48668805,-0.38026094,0.044976678,-0.97968346,-1.7257776,-0.9777964,0.4861157,1.3426597,-0.5406105,-0.30605435,0.5324941,-1.669795,0.36840641,-0.5422924,-0.28550786,-0.4579138,0.16551277,-0.24312922,0.5767892,0.22069342,-0.18655834,-0.5281363,0.074490905,0.7777061,1.6589899,-0.4890143,-0.34353572,0.32292464,0.032084573,0.1291023,0.4565924,0.049531978,1.0821764,-0.2864803,-1.0623794,0.6344735,-0.51094633,0.077342495,-0.95898855,0.1179241,1.7177655,-1.4087344,-0.10564878,0.3267466,-0.39605471,0.27747303,-0.43970522,-1.3722249,1.3058516,-1.0888305,-0.60791576,-1.7078891,-0.5891941,-0.10516642,1.2909583,-0.324867,-0.54970807,-1.2376641,-0.47545418,0.40252447,-0.91711825,-0.57754886,1.672317,0.869704,1.4978188,0.8893115,0.1822385,0.22394988,-1.295827,-0.6136841,-0.5873464,0.8806421,2.5825984,-0.091014795,-1.1915333,-2.0981622,-1.0022849,0.55043215,-0.67359215,0.052576415,0.053184953,-0.039306913,-0.38341224,0.24675876,-0.980464,-0.10165581,0.28791672,0.9050854,-2.4466836,0.64648294,-2.333659,1.0603399,-0.18344468,-0.22829403,1.0014081,-0.9260671,-0.6131323,0.45941782,1.04977,-0.1835494,0.14569658,2.1245694,0.37885854,0.021331005,-0.87023354,-0.18834575,1.012351,-0.70979786,-0.291161,-0.21424562,-0.48673883,-0.5732901,-0.5141262,-0.7896353,0.07193162
543,"Lateral exchange markets (LEMs) are sites of technologically intermediated exchange between actors occupying equivalent network positions. To develop an enriched understanding of these markets, the authors develop a more broad-based and differentiated understanding of peer-to-peer, sharing, and access-based markets. They focus on two key axes: the extent of (1) consociality and (2) platform intermediation. Drawing on these attributes, the authors theoretically deduce four ideal types—Forums, Enablers, Matchmakers, and Hubs. Each type provides value in a different way: Forums connect actors, Enablers equip actors, Matchmakers pair actors, and Hubs centralize exchange. Twenty organizational cases reveal insights into the failure, adaptation, and success of LEMs. Lateral exchange markets shift responsibility for personal and exchange security to relevant personal actors, to institutions, or to the governing algorithms of technology platforms. Extending the general proposition that sociality increasingly infuses market logics, the findings suggest a new frontier in which social resources and software platform algorithms interact as operand resources whose negative consequences (e.g., opportunism) require careful management through assurances and institutional arrangements matched to the type of LEM operation.

544,"Although research has examined the social media–shareholder value link, the role of consumer mindset metrics in this relationship remains unexplored. To this end, drawing on the elaboration likelihood model and accessibility/diagnosticity perspective, the authors hypothesize varying effects of owned and earned social media (OSM and ESM) on brand awareness, purchase intent, and customer satisfaction and link these consumer mindset metrics to shareholder value (abnormal returns and idiosyncratic risk). Analyzing daily data for 45 brands in 21 sectors using vector autoregression models, they find that brand fan following improves all three mindset metrics. ESM engagement volume affects brand awareness and purchase intent but not customer satisfaction, while ESM positive and negative valence have the largest effects on customer satisfaction. OSM increases brand awareness and customer satisfaction but not purchase intent, highlighting a nonlinear effect of OSM. Interestingly, OSM is more likely to increase purchase intent for high involvement utilitarian brands and for brands with higher reputation, implying that running a socially responsible business lends more credibility to OSM. Finally, purchase intent and customer satisfaction positively affect shareholder value.

545,"The authors study specialized personal incentives (SPIs), which are cash rewards granted to salespeople for meeting interim performance goals within the regular sales quota period (monthly, quarterly, etc.). Because firms often institute multiple SPIs, the authors are able to investigate whether different sales achievement trajectories have differential impacts on salespeople's period-end sales performance. The authors find that a steadily growing sales trajectory in a sales period is more strongly associated with period-end success than a sales trajectory that is relatively flat early but has a sharp spike later in the period. Furthermore, although salespeople who had high performance in the prior month (i.e., high-performance state) may be able to draw on superior selling strategies (compared with other salespeople), they too experience a boost in sales performance in the current month by earning SPIs. Notably, the authors also find that although earning SPIs benefits all salespeople, there is a U-shaped relationship between a salesperson's performance state and his or her month-end sales performance. For any specific number of SPIs earned, the probability of meeting and exceeding month-end quotas is boosted more for salespeople with low- and high-performance states than for salespeople with a medium-performance state.

546,"As franchise systems expand, the clustering and resulting proximity of same-brand outlets often become contentious issues. The increased interactions among outlets may facilitate knowledge sharing, even while inducing intrabrand competition. Prior research has considered each possibility—knowledge sharing or intrabrand competition—in isolation, resulting in conflicting recommendations to the central question of whether multiple same-brand outlets should be close to or distant from one another. In this study, the authors take the perspective of the focal outlet and show that the opportunity to share knowledge afforded by clustering-based proximity may or may not be realized, depending on the motivation and ability of the proximal outlets to share knowledge, the focal outlet's ability to absorb knowledge, and the governance context. An analysis of more than 8,000 observations on the 988 outlets of a U.S.-based automotive service franchise system from 1977 to 2012, and corresponding outlet-level sales information from 2004 to 2012, provides support for the authors’ hypotheses.
","We examine the relationship between the presence of a firm’s online presence and the likelihood of a successful acquisition. We find that the presence of a firm’s online presence is associated with a higher likelihood of successful acquisition, whereas the presence of a firm’s offline presence is associated with a lower likelihood of successful acquisition. We also find that the presence of a firm’s online presence is associated with a lower likelihood of successful acquisition, whereas the presence of a firm’s offline presence is associated with a higher likelihood of successful acquisition. We also find that the presence of a firm’s online presence is associated with a lower likelihood of successful acquisition, whereas the presence of a firm’s offline presence is associated with a lower likelihood of successful acquisition. These findings are consistent with the notion that firms are more likely to acquire online than offline, and that the presence of a firm’s online presence is associated with a higher likelihood of successful acquisition.  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \",1.1167568,-0.54248625,-0.4387639,0.107685216,1.6095322,-0.85740167,0.532124,0.809551,0.60403156,0.27205327,0.5587085,0.2086246,-0.55163896,1.1746923,0.21280041,1.052473,0.07859323,-0.25443956,-0.15410505,-1.1052675,0.14765069,-0.01844338,0.85496646,0.7247476,-0.96093917,-0.44456083,1.5650127,-1.0452474,0.7019162,-0.32448968,0.84248286,0.65950376,-0.31249374,-2.4356682,0.037061416,0.56668526,0.19410153,0.289642,-1.2590406,-0.43428236,-0.039489802,0.21793255,1.0705093,-0.22526799,-0.036430683,-1.2377692,0.053400468,-0.601957,0.22905189,-0.21495923,0.92059875,0.38923323,0.13717678,0.02354187,-0.44975394,0.2808278,-0.19354807,1.6782666,0.18390632,-0.6289369,-0.26432392,0.7073548,0.94354963,0.8519088,1.2612295,0.46013653,0.05606709,-0.74401444,-0.3302742,1.4341677,0.14465125,1.1765225,0.47051567,-1.3087361,0.050305765,0.17527428,-0.99887,-0.1172858,-0.06946889,-0.0644913,1.0450119,-0.76538587,0.16190411,0.21172087,-0.31574655,1.2604538,0.10888437,-1.2179328,-0.0011747014,-0.96530944,-0.3285255,0.8244919,-0.8454478,0.42546234,0.02090564,0.34000683,-0.017496055,-0.25445583,1.1758131,0.6450171,0.027219648,0.9408587,-0.41675225,0.18079966,-0.34862924,0.8756565,-0.3946428,0.12766336,-0.32305562,-0.8417373,-0.09830764,1.2835243,1.1776545,-0.3851808,0.3639195,-0.51588535,-0.65347356,0.5808541,-0.29067224,0.40333897,-0.7365746,-0.05618876,-0.71786016,1.0372783,-0.804591,-0.35148168,0.7111431,-0.95632225
547,"Online communities have experienced burgeoning popularity over the last decade and have become a key platform for users to share information and interests, and to engage in social interactions. Drawing on the social contagion literature, the authors examine the effect of online social connections on users’ product purchases in an online community. They assess how product, user, and network characteristics influence the social contagion effect in users’ spending behavior. The authors use a unique large-scale data set from a popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game community—consisting of users’ detailed gaming activities, their social connections, and their in-game purchases of functional and hedonic products—to examine the impact of gamers’ social networks on their purchase behavior. The analysis, based on a double-hurdle model that captures gamers’ decisions of playing and spending levels, reveals evidence of “social dollars,” whereby social interaction between gamers in the community increases their in-game product purchases. Interestingly, the results indicate that social influence varies across different types of products. Specifically, the effect of a focal user's network ties on his or her spending on hedonic products is greater than the effect of network ties on the focal user's spending on functional products. Furthermore, the authors find that user experience negatively moderates social contagion for functional products, whereas it positively moderates contagion for hedonic products. In addition, dense networks enhance contagion over functional product purchases, whereas they mitigate the social influence effect over hedonic product purchases. The authors perform a series of tests and robustness checks to rule out the effect of confounding factors. They supplement their econometric analyses with dynamic matching techniques and estimate average treatment effects. The results of the study have implications for both theory and practice and help provide insights on how managers can monetize social networks and use social information to increase user engagement in online communities.

548,"Practitioners increasingly employ relational price discounts by granting initial discounts to new customers with the goal of building sustainable relationships. However, extant research has provided mixed findings on the long-term effects of initial discounts on customer retention. The current research aims to reconcile this mixed evidence by exploring nonlinear effects of initial discounts on customer retention. Drawing on marketplace metacognition theory, the authors hypothesize that moderate initial discounts (5%–35%) have positive effects on customer retention, whereas low (<5%) and high (>35%) discounts have negative effects. Two large-scale field studies in an insurance company's car insurance branch and property insurance branch provide empirical support for the hypothesized patterns. An additional laboratory experiment tests the psychological mechanism underlying the nonlinear effects. When compared with low and high discounts, moderate initial discounts lead customers to form higher expectations of future relational benefits provided by the firm, as well as to lower their expectations of future discounts. Finally, this research offers customer lifetime value implications based on the depicted findings.
","We propose a novel model of the value of venture capital (VC) investments to support the growth of venture capital (VC) investments. We propose that VC investments are a promising way to increase the value of venture capital investments, but they are not necessarily optimal for the long-term. We propose that VC investments are more likely to be profitable than other types of VC investments, and that the value of VC investments is positively related to the long-term value of venture capital investments. We find that the value of VC investments is positively related to the long-term value of venture capital investments. We also find that the value of VC investments is positively related to the long-term value of venture capital investments. We also find that the value of VC investments is positively related to the long-term value of venture capital investments. Our results suggest that VC investments are more likely to be profitable than other types of VC investments, and that the value of VC investments is positively related to the long-term value of venture capital investments.  We discuss the implications of our findings for VC investment research and practice.  10/29/17  \  11/29/17  \  11/29/17  \  11/29/17",-0.8946172,-0.21072523,-0.91808254,-1.0692406,0.86251223,-0.6889888,-1.4163901,1.3557677,-0.32398936,0.8086923,0.36723036,0.0012742243,-0.7792186,-0.61142343,-0.04348395,0.66946876,-0.4105257,-0.11625956,-0.23171602,-0.42236462,0.7647444,-0.13834246,-1.1910213,0.7245135,-1.8219345,0.095854364,0.5887287,-1.1724199,-0.3316674,-0.42294863,-0.6132593,-0.32541636,-0.38481155,-1.1482648,-1.3457242,0.5628952,1.2201691,0.32402867,-0.30328393,-0.01034464,0.739457,0.3336815,0.023999065,-0.63194317,-0.5174612,-0.3168986,-0.76154286,0.5777856,0.27396613,0.64812404,-0.95613027,-0.9008102,1.3102754,0.80843306,-0.46025866,0.31794634,0.035059195,0.0069198036,-1.4700683,-0.9413922,-1.2552406,0.41534725,-0.07158142,-0.5925048,-0.12040328,-0.9181112,-0.57574034,-0.5993478,0.44154978,0.016906789,-0.46162277,1.3205644,0.0029548204,-1.2078273,0.24706386,1.8911285,-0.6945976,1.3588248,-0.23373145,0.6804395,0.25272793,-1.7530386,-0.33992743,-0.10903995,0.8653264,1.5726962,-0.18532962,-0.9740581,-0.3194445,-1.406026,0.3903536,-0.132727,-0.9059837,-0.786123,0.48811314,-0.0830144,-0.20562157,-0.72055453,0.768445,0.3236075,-0.85803825,-1.7303872,0.33731678,-0.06572005,2.5692483e-05,0.45980754,0.65271807,0.4067958,-0.7282517,-0.6861627,0.17792699,1.5936971,-0.96141565,-0.95989025,1.4633908,0.57960343,-0.042947777,0.027541403,0.4136845,1.810313,-0.24478708,-0.7145834,-0.20211777,-1.4676361,-1.2421203,-0.6926068,0.016539374,-1.0391588
549,"Firms’ boards of directors affect many strategic outcomes. Yet the impact of boards on new products, a key organizational adaptation mechanism, has been overlooked. Addressing this gap, the authors consider the effect of the firm's board interlock centrality, the extent to which board members are connected to boards of other firms, on its new product introductions. They propose that board interlock centrality provides firms access to market intelligence, creating opportunities to introduce incremental new products. Applying the motivation-opportunity-ability theory, the authors propose that two aspects of board leadership moderate this relationship: internal (vs. external) leadership and marketing leadership. They test the hypotheses using a panel of publicly listed U.S. consumer packaged goods firms, in which most new products are incremental innovations. As hypothesized, board interlock centrality increases new product introductions. This effect is stronger when firms have high internal leadership, internal marketing leadership, and a marketing CEO; it is weaker with high intra-industry external leadership. The findings highlight the unexpected role of board interlocks on innovation outcomes and advance the literature on marketing leadership, board interlocks, and social networks.

550,"This article demonstrates that the sales literature is converging on a systemic and institutional perspective that recognizes that selling and value creation unfold over time and are embedded in broader social systems. This convergence illustrates that selling needs a more robust theoretical foundation. To contribute to this foundation, the authors draw on institutional theory and service-dominant logic to advance a service ecosystems perspective. This perspective leads them to redefine selling in terms of the interaction between actors aimed at creating and maintaining thin crossing points—the locations at which service can be efficiently exchanged for service—through the ongoing alignment of institutional arrangements and the optimization of relationships. This definition underscores how broad sets of human actors engage in selling processes, regardless of the roles that characterize them (e.g., firm, customer, stakeholder). A service ecosystems perspective reveals (1) that selling continues to be an essential activity, (2) how broader sets of actors participate in selling processes, and (3) how this participation may be changing. It leads to novel insights and questions regarding gaining and maintaining business, managing intrafirm and broad external selling actors, and sales performance.
","We examine the role of organizational learning in the development of organizational value systems (OSS). We argue that the role of organizational learning in the development of value systems is not limited to the development of value systems but also extends to the development of value systems in the context of organizational learning. We argue that organizational learning is a dynamic process that can be characterized by multiple interrelated processes, including the development of value systems, the development of value systems in the context of organizational learning, and the development of value systems in the context of organizational learning. We argue that organizational learning is a dynamic process that can be characterized by multiple interrelated processes, including the development of value systems, the development of value systems in the context of organizational learning, and the development of value systems in the context of organizational learning.

551,"Investor demand has promoted share repurchases to the dominating payout instrument for U.S. firms. However, critics worry that the repurchase boom leads to firms neglecting long-term investments. Even worse, scholars have shown that investor pressure also motivates firms to cut marketing investments with the aim of boosting short-term income, a practice called myopic marketing management. Extant theory still lacks an understanding of whether and how the co-occurrence of share repurchases and myopic marketing affects firm stakeholders such as investors and consumers. Using a large-scale cross-industry sample, the authors reveal that there is a higher share of firms cutting marketing investments among repurchasing firms than among nonrepurchasing firms. Furthermore, investors immediately respond negatively to myopic firms that also repurchase shares. Finally, repurchases and myopic marketing are also associated with an increase in product recalls. This first study to assess share repurchases through a marketing lens hence reveals negative effects on both the stock and the consumer markets.

552,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces, such as Uber, Airbnb, and Lending Club, have experienced massive growth in recent years. They now constitute a significant portion of the world's economy and provide opportunities for people to transact directly with one another. However, such growth also challenges participants to cope with information asymmetry about the quality of the offerings in the marketplace. By conducting an analysis of a P2P lending market, the authors propose and test a theory in which countersignaling provides a mechanism to attenuate information asymmetry about financial products (loans) offered on the platform. Data from a P2P lending website reveal significant, nonmonotonic relationships among the transmission of nonverifiable information, loan funding, and ex post loan quality, consistent with the proposed theory. The results provide insights for platform owners who seek to manage the level of information asymmetry in their P2P environments to create more balanced marketplaces, as well as for P2P participants interested in improving their ability to process information about the goods and services they seek to transact online.

553,"To develop the knowledge and skill sets of channel partner firms, manufacturers increasingly introduce learning programs as part of their relationship management strategies. However, the engagement of channel partners in these programs tends to be low. The current research, conducted in collaboration with a Fortune 100 information technology company, examines ways to strengthen learning engagement. In accordance with self-regulated learning theory, the authors propose and demonstrate that when channel partners write reviews of a learning module that they attended, beyond providing ratings, they are better able to reflect on the relevance of their learning experience and are further engaged in learning activities. The audience and focus of these written reviews determine the engagement of the channel partner sales personnel; therefore, review writing is a valuable, informal mechanism to motivate them. These effects are moderated by characteristics of both the channel partner (salesperson's learning orientation and identification with the manufacturer) and the relationship with the manufacturer (length and exclusivity).

554,"In this study, the authors assess the effects of a data breach announcement (DBA) by a multichannel retailer on customer behavior. They exploit a natural experiment and use individual customer transaction data from the retailer to conduct a detailed and systematic empirical examination of the effects of a DBA on customer spending and channel migration behavior. To identify the effects, the authors compare the change in customer behavior before and after the DBA between a treatment group (customers whose information is breached) and a control group (customers whose information is not breached) using the difference-in-differences modeling framework. They find that although the data breach results in a significant decrease in customer spending, customers of the firm migrate from the breached to the unbreached channels of the retailer. The findings further reflect that customers with a higher retailer patronage are more forgiving because the negative effects of the DBA are lower for customers with a higher level of patronage. The authors propose and empirically test for the role of customer data vulnerability as the behavioral mechanism that drives customer behavior subsequent to a DBA. The authors offer prescriptions for managers on how to engage with customers following DBAs.

555,"The authors examine an increasingly popular open innovation practice, “design crowdsourcing,” wherein firms seek external inputs in the form of functional design solutions for new product development from the “crowd.” They investigate conditions under which managers crowdsource design and determine whether such decisions subsequently boost product sales. The empirical analysis is guided by qualitative insights gathered from executive interviews. The authors use a novel data set from a pioneering crowdsourcing firm and find that three concept design characteristics—perceived usability, reliability, and technical complexity—are associated with the decision to crowdsource design. They use an instrumental variable method accounting for the endogenous nature of crowdsourcing decisions to understand when such a decision affects downstream sales. The authors find that design crowdsourcing is positively related to unit sales and that this effect is moderated by the idea quality of the initial product concept. Using a change-score analysis of consumer ratings, they find that design crowdsourcing enhances perceived reliability and usability. They discuss the strategic implications of involving the crowd, beyond ideation, in helping transform ideas into effective products.

556,"Suppliers are increasingly being forced by dominant retailers to clean up their supply chains. These retailers argue that their sustainability mandates may translate into profits for suppliers, but many suppliers are cynical about these mandates because the onus to undertake the required investments is on them while potential gains may be usurped by the mandating retailer. We examine whether supplier fears are justified by studying the impact of Walmart's sustainability mandate on its suppliers’ (short-term) shareholder value. Although about two-thirds of suppliers are indeed financially harmed, approximately one-third benefit. To delve deeper into this variation, we relate suppliers’ short-term abnormal returns to Walmart's appropriation power and explore whether and to what extent a supplier's referent and expert power sources, derived from its marketing and operational characteristics, respectively, can counteract Walmart's appropriation attempts. We find that the supplier's marketing characteristics (its environmental reputation, brand equity, and advertising) provide it with the countervailing power needed to resist Walmart's appropriation attempts. In contrast, cost-efficient suppliers and suppliers that invest heavily in R&D have more difficulty withstanding Walmart's squeeze attempts.
","We examine the impact of a firm’s strategic decision to invest in a technology-enabled product (e.g., a smartphone) on the firm’s profit margins. We find that firms that invest in a technology-enabled product (e.g., a smartphone) are more likely to invest in a lower-cost product (e.g., a smartphone) and to invest in a higher-cost product (e.g., a smartphone).

557,"The present research decomposes consumer donation behavior into two components: donation choice (i.e., whether to donate) and donation amount (i.e., how much to donate). It then considers how information related to the donor and information related to characteristics of the soliciting organization may differentially influence the two decisions. Results from four field experiments suggest that donor-related appeals have a greater effect on the donation choice decision (vs. organization-related appeals), whereas organization-related appeals have a greater effect on the donation amount decision (vs. donor-related appeals). This might lead one to conclude that presenting both types of appeals in a solicitation is ideal. However, the studies presented herein also suggest that this strategy may backfire. The simultaneous presentation of donor- and organization-related appeals can hamper both donation response rates and average contribution amounts. To address this issue, the authors identify and test an alternative solicitation strategy for maximizing solicitation effectiveness. This strategy involves a multistep request process that capitalizes on an understanding of the differential influence of donor- and organization-related information on donation choice and amount decisions.

558,"The impact of market share on financial firm performance is one of the most widely studied relationships in marketing strategy research. However, since the meta-analysis by Szymanski, Bharadwaj, and Varadarajan (1993), substantial environmental (e.g., digitization) and methodological (e.g., accounting for endogeneity) developments have occurred. The current work presents an updated and extended meta-analysis based on all available 863 elasticities drawn from 89 studies and provides the following new empirical generalizations: (1) The average raw market share–financial performance elasticity is .132, which is substantially lower than the effectiveness of other intermediate marketing metrics. This result challenges a widely used strategy that solely focuses on increasing market share. (2) Elasticities differ significantly between contextual settings. For example, they are lower for business-to-business firms than for business-to-consumer firms, for service firms than for manufacturing firms, and for U.S. markets than for emerging and Western European markets. The authors also observe differences between countries with respect to a general time trend (e.g., lower elasticities in recent times for Western European markets) and recessionary periods (e.g., lower elasticities in the United States, higher elasticities in non-Western economies).

559,"Managers frequently seek strategies to profit systematically from social media to increase product sales. By forming a brand alliance, they can acquire an installed social media base from a partner brand in an attempt to boost the sales of their composite products. Drawing from power theory, this article develops a conceptual model of the influence of the social media power of partner brands on brand alliance success. The proposed framework details the partner brand's social media power potential (size and activity of the social media network), social media power exertion (different posting behaviors and comments), and their interaction. The authors test this framework with an extensive data set from the film industry, in which films function as composite products and actors represent partner brands. The data set features 442 movies, including 1,318 actor–movie combinations and weekly social media data (including 41,547 coded Facebook posts). The authors apply a linear mixed-effects model, in which they account for endogeneity concerns. The partner brand's social media power potential, power exertion, and their interaction can all lead to higher composite product sales. By coding different types of product-related posts, this article provides estimates of their varying monetary value.

560,"The literature examining the effect of sales control on salesperson performance is, at best, equivocal. To reconcile inconsistencies in empirical findings, this research introduces two new types of salesperson learning: exploratory and exploitative learning. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, the authors conceptualize exploratory learning as promotion focused and exploitative learning as prevention focused and find that salespeople exhibit both exploratory and exploitative learning, though one is used more than the other depending on the type of sales control employed. The results also suggest that the fit between salesperson learning type, customer characteristics (i.e., purchase-decision-making complexity), and salesperson characteristics (i.e., preference for sales predictability) is critical to salesperson performance and that salesperson learning mediates the relationship between sales control and salesperson performance (Study 1). Study 2 corroborates the findings using new panel data collected over two waves. The results of this research have important implications for integrating sales control, salesperson learning, and salesperson performance.

561,"The use of celebrity endorsements varies across countries; does their effectiveness similarly vary across cultures? The authors propose that power distance beliefs (PDB), a cultural orientation related to the extent to which people expect and accept differences in power, moderate the effects of celebrity endorsements. A positive effect of celebrity endorsers on evaluations of advertising should be more potent with greater PDB; source expertise and trustworthiness likely underlie this effect. To test the hypotheses, the authors use moderated mediation analyses, with corrections for measurement error and endogeneity of the mediators (source expertise and trustworthiness). The results of three studies, using both manipulated and measured PDB for respondents in different countries and with a variety of endorsers, demonstrate that PDB determine the effectiveness of celebrity endorsements on attitudes toward the advertisement and the brand. In support of the moderated mediation model, perceptions of source expertise and trust mediate the effect of celebrity endorsements, conditional on PDB. The results hold for nondurables but do not generalize to durable products.

562,"Regulatory oversight that affects the firm's product-market environment continues to increase. Political management capital (PMC) describes firm expenditure committed to address the political and regulatory context. Neoinstitutional theory casts PMC as an institutionally expected normative response investors use when evaluating firm performance. Although limited evidence has suggested that firms benefit from PMC, the authors demonstrate its effects across financial outcomes including firm value, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Likewise, they examine how PMC interacts with a firm's product market through research-and-development (R&D) capital and advertising capital. Regression analysis of an unbalanced data set of 212 firms in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry, tracked from 2003 to 2014, reveals that while PMC improves investor expectations through firm value and systematic risk, it increases idiosyncratic risk. The authors find that PMC plays both substitutive and complementary roles with R&D such that increasing levels of both PMC and R&D weakens main effects. Political management capital has limited, but substitutive, effects with advertising likely because there is less regulatory oversight on advertising versus R&D in this industry. The authors explore these asymmetric effects, provide implications for neoinstitutional theory, and offer managerial insights.

563,"Third-party recognition for design excellence is often viewed as an event triggering the success of a product with a good design. However, evidence from extant research raises doubt as to whether this form of recognition matters in business-to-business (B2B) markets. Using a demand shock conceptualization to capture the signaling role and demand uncertainty of such recognition, this research argues that third-party recognition for design excellence does create firm value in B2B markets. The effect varies, however, depending on certain types of chief executive officer functional experience (market and finance) and the criteria used by third parties in judging design superiority. Model-free evidence and matched-sample analysis provides empirical evidence in support of the demand shock perspective and the hypothesized effects. The research adds a new theoretical conceptualization describing the impact of third-party recognition for design excellence and unveils several new research areas. Managerially, the results identify several new facilitating conditions that enable B2B firms to create greater value from an innovation strategy based on superior design.

564,"The authors investigate compliance behavior and revenue implications in winner-pay and voluntary-pay auctions in charity and noncharity settings. In the voluntary-pay format, the seller asks all bidders to pay their own high bid. The authors explore motives and boundary conditions for compliance behavior based on internal and external triggers of social norms. The voluntary-pay format generates higher revenue than the winner-pay format for charity auctions, despite imperfect compliance, but it generates lower revenues in noncharity settings. To characterize bidding strategy, the authors study time to bid, auction choice, and jump bidding and find evidence that bidders in voluntary-pay auctions more commonly use jump bidding and late entry. The findings have important implications for marketing managers, augmenting the growing stream of empirical auction studies and work on corporate social responsibility. Specifically, combining an auction with a charitable cause may result in increased revenues, but managers should ensure that they are accounting for differential compliance rates between auction formats. Even if low-compliance bidders can be identified and screened out, doing so is not advantageous, because noncompliant bidders bid up prices.

565,"This article develops a decision-making framework that highlights how display of numeric attribute information (e.g., display of calorie information) and shoppers’ goals (i.e., having a diet focus vs. a taste focus) jointly influence shoppers’ choices and preferences. Across two sets of studies, including a field study involving the launch of a new Coca-Cola product, the authors show that when food items are displayed in an aligned manner (i.e., when food items with lower-value calorie information are displayed below food items with higher calorie values), shoppers assign more importance weight to calorie gap information. In turn, higher importance weight assigned to calorie gap information leads diet-focused shoppers to relatively prefer low-calorie food items but leads taste-focused shoppers to relatively prefer higher-calorie food items. The third set of studies shows that this decision-making framework has widespread applicability and is relevant in any domain in which advertising, retail, and online displays show comparisons of numeric attribute information.

566,"In an age of digitalized interactions, offerings are no longer “finished” in the traditional sense; creation of value continues by engaging actors (often consumers and their associated social networks) interacting with organizing actors (often firms and their associated organizational ecosystem) in a joint space of interactive system-environments. One can think of the Apple Watch NikePlus (AWNP) offering in which the consumer co-creates valuable experienced outcomes with a mix of applications, touchpoints, and uses, while AWNP and its organizing actors co-create environments with consumers. Actors increasingly find themselves in such a joint enactment of interactional value creation, through offerings as evolving digitalized networked arrangements of artifacts, persons, processes, and interfaces, which the authors refer to as a Digitalized Interactive Platform (DIP). This implies a broader view of value creation—one in which value is created through interactions, versus one where value is simply the exchange of a fixed offering between a firm and its customers. Offerings as DIPs have significant implications for the theory and practice of marketing.

567,"Careers evolve over time and can take many paths as they develop. Within marketing and sales, a common variant of career progression is to begin in a sales position and then advance internally into a marketing role. Doing so provides employees with unique but complementary sets of skills, experiences, and perspectives that may increase their efficacy as marketers. However, sales-to-marketing job transitions (SMJTs) can also be suboptimal and result in adverse outcomes. Although the sales–marketing interface literature has examined how the two functions work together, the SMJT process is unclear. To provide an understanding of this phenomenon, the authors conduct in-depth interviews across a host of different companies and industries with 56 informants who successfully transitioned intraorganizationally from sales to marketing, informants who transitioned but did not remain in marketing, and executives. They develop a theoretical model consisting of transition motivation, acquisition, preparation, and encounter. They also advance individual and organizational facilitators of SMJTs and discuss SMJTs’ potential positive and negative effects on the organization.

568,"Multinational corporations (MNCs) are adopting increasingly diverse and complex marketing channels to sell their products worldwide. They strive to manage channels that confront diverse demands from headquarters, foreign subsidiaries, and local partners as well as complex market environments. Because extant research on MNCs’ marketing channels is sparse, the authors propose an organizing framework to spur and guide research on MNC channel management. As a meta-theory that integrates economic and social elements of MNC channel management, the political economy perspective is used to propose two testable frameworks pertaining to determinants of (1) MNC marketing channel structures and processes and (2) MNC marketing channel outcomes. Building on these frameworks, the authors advance a research agenda to test substantive relationships, elaborate new constructs, and illustrate new contexts pertaining to MNC marketing channels. A set of propositions illustrates the applicability of these conceptual frameworks.

569,"Commonly, a coupon can be applied to one of several vertically differentiated products sold at different prices within the same product line of a brand. With such a product-line coupon, consumers need to decide on the specific product to buy, resulting in different levels of consumer spending. One field data set and four lab experiments demonstrate that the relationship between coupon face value and consumer spending level may not always be intuitively positive; under certain circumstances, it could take an inverted U-shape. The authors develop a threshold-based model to explain the inverted U-shaped effect of coupon face value on consumer spending level and show that this effect occurs when the price level of products is high, when consumers have a strong saving orientation, when they experience low information load from processing a small number of products, when they are inclined to engage in thorough product comparison, or when they have a weak preexisting preference for a specific level of product benefit.

570,"Consumers have an increasingly wide variety of options available to entertain themselves. This poses a challenge for content aggregators who want to effectively promote their video content online through original trailers of movies, sitcoms, and video games. Marketers are now trying to produce much shorter video clips to promote their content on a variety of digital channels. This research is the first to propose an approach to produce such clips and to study their effectiveness, focusing on comedy movies as an application. Web-based facial-expression tracking is used to study viewers’ real-time emotional responses when watching comedy movie trailers online. These data are used to predict both viewers’ intentions to watch the movie and the movie's box office success. The authors then propose an optimization procedure for cutting scenes from trailers to produce clips and test it in an online experiment and in a field experiment. The results provide evidence that the production of short clips using the proposed methodology can be an effective tool to market movies and other online content.

571,"This research examines consumers’ general in-store mobile phone use and shopping behavior. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that mobile phone use decreases point-of-purchase sales, but the results of the current study indicate instead that it can increase purchases overall. Using eye-tracking technology in both a field study and a field experiment, matched with sales receipts and survey responses, the authors show that mobile phone use (vs. nonuse) and actual mobile phone use patterns both lead to increased purchases, because consumers divert from their conventional shopping loop, spend more time in the store, and spend more time examining products and prices on shelves. Building on attention capacity theories, this study proposes and demonstrates that the underlying mechanism for these effects is distraction. This article also provides some insights into boundary conditions of the mobile phone use effect.

572,"Intuition suggests that a salesperson should not refer consumers to a competitor for products that they both sell. However, myriad examples reveal salespeople doing just that. The authors study specialist competitor referrals, a sales strategy by which one increases consumers’ purchase likelihood of a focal product (e.g., a painting at an art gallery) by (1) referring consumers to a competitor (e.g., a frame warehouse store) that offers a nonfocal product (e.g., a frame) at a lower price, while (2) stating that the stores differ in their specializations (i.e., the stores concentrate their efforts on different goods). Using a study and survey with salespeople, experimental studies, an incentivized negotiation experiment, and a field study, the authors show that specialist competitor referrals can indeed benefit sellers. Specifically, they build on equity theory to show that specialist competitor referrals increase focal product sales by reducing consumers’ perceived overpayment risk for the focal product via increasing perceived equity in the exchange. The authors also show that competitor referrals for nonfocal products that do not justify the price difference on the nonfocal product are ineffective.

573,"The increased penetration of mobile devices has a significant impact on customers’ online shopping behavior, with customers frequently switching between mobile and fixed devices on the path to purchase. By accounting for the attributes of the devices and the perceived risks related to each product category, the authors develop hypotheses regarding the relationship between device switching and conversion rates. They test the hypotheses by analyzing clickstream data from a large online retailer and apply propensity score matching to account for self-selection in device switching. They find that when customers switch from a more mobile device, such as a smartphone, to a less mobile device, such as a desktop, their conversion rate is significantly higher. This effect is larger when product category–related perceived risk is higher, when the product price is higher, and when the customer's experience with the product category and the online retailer is lower. The findings illustrate the importance of focusing on conversions across the combination of devices used by customers on their path to purchase. Focusing on the conversions on a single device in isolation, as is usually done in practice, significantly overestimates conversions attributed to fixed devices at the expense of those attributed to mobile devices.

574,"Many companies compete globally in a world in which user ratings and price are important drivers of performance but whose importance may differ by country. This study builds on the cultural, economic, and structural differences across countries to examine how app popularity reacts to price and ratings, controlling for product characteristics. Estimated across 60 countries, a dynamic panel model with product-specific effects reveals that price sensitivity is higher in countries with higher masculinity and uncertainty avoidance. Ratings valence sensitivity is higher in countries with higher individualism and uncertainty avoidance, while ratings volume sensitivity is higher in countries with higher power distance and uncertainty avoidance and those that are richer and have more income equality. For managers, the authors visualize country groups and calculate how much price should decrease to compensate for a negative review or lack of reviews. For researchers, they highlight the moderators of the volume and valence effects of online ratings, which are becoming ubiquitous in this connected world.

575,"Well-known brands are frequently imitated, misused, or tampered with. Firms facing these threats routinely turn to the legal system and file trademark infringement lawsuits in an attempt to prevent revenue losses and brand equity dilution. In this article, the authors address the largely unexplored issue of brand protection. First, they categorize all major types of trademark infringement. Second, using signaling and prospect theories, they present a conceptual model that outlines the financial consequences of defending a brand in court. The authors test the predictions of this framework using a large sample of trademark infringement lawsuits and find that although investors react negatively in the short term to firms’ filing and even to firms’ winning such cases, the long-term performance of firms that successfully leverage the legal system to protect their brands is positive.

576,"Scholars identify several benefits of new product introductions (NPI), yet prior literature largely overlooks how the process of NPI generates marketplace insights and influences subsequent products. Building on the concept of absorptive capacity, the authors argue that the influence of products on firm value depends on process characteristics, namely, the pace, irregularity, and scope of NPI. Using data collected from multiple sources for products introduced by pharmaceutical firms between 1991 and 2015 and robust econometric methods that account for endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, this study reveals that pace and scope have an inverted U-shaped effect on firm value, whereas irregularity negatively influences firm value. Moreover, strategic emphasis and product complexity negatively moderate the relationship of the irregularity and scope of NPI with firm value. This research documents the importance of adopting a portfolio approach to the sequential introduction of new products and incorporating insights gained from previous product introductions; it cautions managers against evaluating products in isolation. The authors discuss the economic significance of these results and provide actionable guidance for managers.

577,"Scholars have expressed concern that marketing's influence at the strategic levels of the firm is waning. Consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms’ board members have marketing experience. The authors suggest that this is shortsighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (MEBMs) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. Drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact of MEBMs on firm growth. Using 64,086 director biographies from S&P 1500 firms, the authors find that MEBMs positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. The findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage.

578,"Drawing on goal-setting theory, this study develops a new self-selected incentive scheme. Within this scheme, a sales employee chooses an individualized goal–reward level combination from a menu the firm proposes given the employee's past performance. To test the effects of the self-selected incentive scheme, the authors conducted two field experiments at two Fortune 500 companies. Results of both experiments show that, compared with two equivalent quota systems, sales employees’ performance increased substantially under the self-selected incentive scheme. In addition, findings reveal that the performance increase induced by this scheme is substantially greater for sales employees with a high variation in past performance and for employees with a low past-performance level. Moreover, the authors find that the effects of the self-selected incentive scheme not only are durable when offered again but also persist after the scheme is discontinued. Through two additional online experiments, the authors extend the findings of the field studies, isolate the self-selected incentive scheme's three underlying mechanisms, and examine each mechanism's relative strength.

579,"Evidence from four studies suggests that the moral opposition toward genetically modified (GM) foods impedes the perception of their benefits, and critically, marketers can circumvent this moral opposition by employing subtle cues to position these products as being “man-made.” Specifically, if consumers view the GM food as man-made, and if they understand why it was created, moral opposition to the product diminishes, and the GM food's perceived benefits increase, which subsequently increases purchase intentions for the product. This effect is replicated in the field (in both controlled and naturalistic settings), in a laboratory experiment, and with an online consumer panel. The results suggest that marketers can help consumers better consider all information when assessing the merits of GM foods by using packaging and promotion strategies to cue consumers to view the GM food for what it is (i.e., a man-made object created with intent). The findings have implications for the recent GM food labeling debate.

580,"Research on market orientation finds that market-driven firms succeed by identifying and appealing to consumer needs. Yet many technologically innovative firms achieve remarkable success by taking a market-driving approach. The ways that firms drive markets without disruptive innovation, however, remain unclear. Adopting a market-systems perspective, the authors conduct an ethnographic analysis of producers, distributors, retailers, critics, and consumers in the U.S. wine market. They find that firms drive the market by playing a status game. Firms pursue a vision and advance that vision among influencers inside and outside the industry to gain recognition. Winners of the status game influence and drive social consensus by setting benchmarks and shaping consumer preferences to the firm's advantage. High status is difficult to imitate, creating an advantage that can endure for years or decades.

581,"The success of a freemium model depends on the number of customers who purchase the premium version in the presence of the free version. The authors investigate the strategy of extending the premium product line to spur demand for the existing premium version. Extending the results of the standard product line model is insufficient in such cases because of the conceptual nuances in a freemium context. The authors conduct a randomized field experiment with an online content provider that offers book titles in a PDF version for free and sells the paperback version for a premium. The authors show that paperback titles accompanied by an additional premium version, either in e-book or hardcover format, have higher sales than those in the control condition. The positive impact on paperback sales is stronger for titles that are more popular or cheaper, and the effect of introducing the e-book version is higher when the e-book price is closer to the paperback price. By analyzing individual customer choices, the authors identify the existence of the compromise effect and the attraction effect in the extended product line setting, a significant contribution not only in the freemium context but also to the product line literature.

582,"Globalization and technology have expanded the reach of sports teams, giving brand sponsors new opportunities to engage and build relationships in real time with fans outside a team’s home market. This research investigates the role of fan isolation, or the experience of feeling separated from the team community, in shaping sponsorship effectiveness. The authors posit that such isolation increases the desire to affiliate with the team community, which can increase preferences for team-linked brands. However, the effect of isolation on sponsor performance depends on the strength of fan identification. Isolation increases strong fans’ desire to affiliate with the team community, thereby enhancing sponsorship performance; by contrast, isolation causes weak fans to avoid team-linked brands. Two field studies and four quasi experiments conducted across three countries (N = 1,412) confirm these predictions. Isolated strong fans exhibit increased recall, attitudes, purchase intentions, and word of mouth for sponsors, while isolated weak fans display the opposite effects. For brand managers, the proposed framework reveals whether isolated fans provide the best or worst returns on their sponsorships.
","We investigate the impact of social media on the social capital of a new product. We find that social media influence the social capital of new product development teams (SDs) by influencing the social capital of the team’s peers. SDs’ social capital is positively related to the team’s social capital, whereas the team’s social capital is negatively related to the team’s social capital. SDs’ social capital is positively related to the team’s social capital, whereas the team’s social capital is negatively related to the team’s social capital. SDs’ social capital is positively related to the team’s social capital, whereas the team�s social capital is negatively related to the team�s social capital. SDs’ social capital is positively related to the team�s social capital, whereas the team�s social capital is negatively related to the team�s social capital. These findings contribute to the literature on social capital and the development of new product development teams.  We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of new product development teams and the development of new product development teams.  10/11/17  10/11/17",0.24228294,-0.03642773,-0.4004903,-1.9510047,0.8082686,-0.24560739,-0.58658147,0.17850235,0.25906953,0.7426946,1.0402719,-0.15524182,0.01070642,-0.26945078,0.15525916,0.30527738,-0.49785876,-0.2232029,-0.23126404,0.41157955,0.3860998,0.25150067,-1.4179386,1.161168,-2.0899465,0.070781864,0.64473176,-0.33666438,1.017436,-0.6930954,0.4695819,0.8656209,-1.7322454,-2.5026877,0.36916393,0.6652854,1.0800107,0.97264344,-0.0304358,0.66337687,-0.2015822,0.03471196,0.27495024,-0.564553,-0.50550956,-0.8738738,0.05448821,0.4619183,0.16843662,0.3454561,1.0051781,-0.2706626,1.197388,1.4776299,-0.7934585,1.2493917,0.5498734,0.22927128,-0.71144646,-0.72972494,-0.9614729,0.7520467,0.39419112,-0.3610886,1.3044996,-1.1326876,-0.42953724,-0.07048321,0.29540247,-0.36265185,0.19532616,0.4308358,0.7103959,-1.3076568,-0.37521735,0.93215317,0.36078766,-0.09214006,-0.75592965,-0.21942785,0.70773643,-1.162534,0.41264576,1.0593486,0.44678485,0.8609096,0.09085991,-0.26588446,-0.569636,-0.9804565,0.63000447,0.40854684,-0.87194747,-1.2039068,0.9535179,-0.6363357,-0.6815469,0.2879345,0.43882313,0.7773164,0.5628607,-0.5294913,0.5469852,0.16302992,-0.3830964,0.6681471,-0.77868277,1.1599685,0.22105467,-0.88858646,-0.36015368,0.91769433,1.8468535,1.1203636,1.2671351,0.12881954,-0.022309877,1.0124602,0.22491275,1.1562643,-0.9827746,-0.030475996,-0.50215966,-0.0986706,-1.3529954,-0.7205484,0.07146317,-0.6189791
583,"The marketing–finance interface literature has investigated the direct link between innovativeness and stock returns. The authors extend this research by focusing on two open questions: How and under what conditions is innovativeness associated with stock returns? Answering these questions is important for managers who have to defend innovation investments to board members and time the introductions of new products. The authors investigate large individual investors and their national culture in the food and beverage industry. Combining multiple data sets, they first examine the relationship between innovativeness and large individual investors’ stock holding decisions (i.e., to sell, hold onto, or buy a firm’s stocks). The results indicate that national culture moderates this relationship. At the firm level, the authors show that large investors’ stock holding partially mediates the innovativeness–stock returns relationship and that the culture of a firm’s large investors moderates this mediated relationship. Thus, they unveil a special segment of investors, large individual investors, who influence the extent to which firms benefit from innovativeness in the stock market in the food and beverage industry.

584,"Although sales force downsizing represents a challenging marketing resource change that can signal uncertainty about future firm performance, little is known about its impact on financial-market performance. Drawing from information economics, the authors address this knowledge gap by developing a comprehensive framework to (1) examine the impact of the size of a firm’s sales force downsizing on firm-idiosyncratic risk, (2) uncover investors’ screening processes that influence this relationship, and (3) identify firms’ mitigating signaling processes that can alleviate investor uncertainty linked to downsizing. The authors draw from several secondary sources to assemble a longitudinal data set of 314 U.S. public firms over 12 years and model their framework using a robust econometric approach. Findings show that larger sales force reductions are associated with greater firm-idiosyncratic risk. Furthermore, this increase in risk is amplified when firms face high levels of future competitive threats and lack transparency in financial reporting. However, chief executive officers can mitigate these deleterious moderating effects by signaling a commitment to growth (i.e., increasing advertising expenditures) and formally communicating an external strategic focus to Wall Street.

585,"Content platforms (e.g., newspapers, magazines) post several stories daily on their dedicated social media pages and promote some of them using targeted content advertising (TCA). Posting stories enables content platforms to grow their social media audiences and generate digital advertising revenue from the impressions channeled through social media posts’ link clicks. However, optimal scheduling of social media posts and TCA is formidable, requiring content platforms to determine what to post; when to post; and whether, when, and how much to spend on TCA to maximize profits. Social media managers lament this complexity, and academic literature offers little guidance. Consequently, the authors draw from literature on circadian rhythms in information processing capabilities to build a novel theoretical framework on social media content scheduling and explain how scheduling attributes (i.e., time of day, content type, and TCA) affect the link clicks metric. They test their hypotheses using a model estimated on 366 days of Facebook post data from a top 50 U.S. newspaper. Subsequently, they build an algorithm that allows social media managers to optimally plan social media content schedules and maximize gross profits. Applying the algorithm to a holdout sample, the authors demonstrate a potential increase in gross profits by at least 8%.
","We study the impact of online advertising on the sales of a large online retailer. We use a data set of 1,973,922 sales reports from a large online retailer to analyze the impact of online advertising on sales. We find that online advertising increases sales by approximately $1.2 billion per year, and the effect of online advertising on sales is larger for women than for men. We also find that online advertising increases sales by approximately $1.2 billion per year for men, and for women, by approximately $1.3 billion per year. We also find that online advertising increases sales by approximately $1.3 billion per year for men, and for women, by approximately $1.4 billion per year. We also find that online advertising increases sales by approximately $1.5 billion per year for women, and for men, by approximately $1.6 billion per year. We also find that online advertising increases sales by approximately $1.7 billion per year for men, and for women, by approximately $1.8 billion per year. We also find that online advertising increases sales by approximately $1.9 billion per year for women, and for men, by approximately $1.10 billion per year.",0.35901704,0.8808229,-0.10486693,-0.54740596,-0.071906626,0.3167581,-0.102038115,0.4017066,1.050587,-0.5700301,-0.014796345,0.17564401,0.6817019,-0.42170888,-1.3563745,-0.17318775,0.24670307,-0.517534,0.26477334,-0.97963864,-0.6085243,-1.2609702,0.046544276,0.8153346,-1.7085038,-0.18646657,0.12710881,-0.12759326,1.1663553,-0.83220977,-0.17514153,-1.3554301,-2.4784586,-0.7405545,0.33150697,-0.003589401,0.43725565,0.43993315,-0.20361662,0.4492959,-0.25266483,-1.3268589,0.45202857,-0.6661841,-0.004715239,1.1357732,-1.1744806,1.0436709,-0.3628821,-0.5653486,0.18076381,0.18533921,0.23403676,0.74740964,-0.9520547,-0.010881504,0.2934607,0.35793576,-0.14316809,-0.32690728,-0.6450539,0.66635346,0.24550815,0.027345939,-0.9381937,-0.19213411,-0.37955076,0.4390335,0.33463103,-0.14047916,-0.5510768,-0.64395404,1.0164927,-0.66108876,-0.59388846,0.6361469,0.107429616,0.0079600625,-0.5710511,-0.45662266,-0.4328459,-0.7764442,-0.6678773,1.5399036,0.82242477,1.6942878,0.19058889,-0.00750133,-1.1549101,-0.78345525,1.27154,0.10547227,-0.22993441,-0.46287617,0.24834812,-0.6177042,0.23646554,-0.36850086,0.87309146,-0.15546493,-0.35561243,-0.72543013,-0.4773421,-0.10193414,0.04505272,-0.26730484,0.41264263,1.1074175,-0.23458354,-0.97756946,0.11549026,-0.31651735,-0.04593156,1.6224114,0.62589306,0.2575856,0.3341266,-0.3249982,0.66803044,1.8356532,0.41891196,-0.42676434,-0.45723417,0.8999635,-0.19875701,-0.509847,-0.31838506,-0.13895738
586,"Prior research has shown the independent effects of average product ratings and number of reviews for online purchases, but the relative influence of these aggregate review attributes is still debated in the literature. In this research, the authors demonstrate the conditional influences of these two attributes as a function of the valence of average product ratings and the level of review numbers in a choice set. Specifically, they argue that the diagnosticity of the number of reviews, relative to average product ratings, increases when average product ratings are negative or neutral (vs. positive) and when the level of review numbers in a choice set is low (vs. high). As a result, when consumers choose among the best options on one of the review attributes (average product ratings or the number of reviews), their preference shifts from the higher-rated option with fewer reviews toward the lower-rated option with more reviews. The authors demonstrate this preference shift in seven studies, elucidate the underlying process by which this occurs, and conclude with a discussion of the implications for retailers and brands.

587,"This research distinguishes between the goal of maintaining status and advancing status and investigates how consumers’ political ideology triggers sensitivity to a status-maintenance (vs. status-advancement) goal, subsequently altering luxury consumption. Because conservative political ideology increases the preference for social stability, the authors propose that conservatives (vs. liberals) are more sensitive to status maintenance (but not status advancement) and thus exhibit a greater desire for luxury goods when the status-maintenance goal is activated. Six studies assessing status maintenance using sociodemographic characteristics (Studies 1, 2, and 3a) and controlled manipulations, including ad framing (Study 3b) and semantic priming (Studies 4 and 5), provide support for this proposition. The studies show that the effect is specific to status maintenance and does not occur (1) in the absence of a status goal or (2) when the status-advancement goal (a focus on increasing status) is activated. Overall, the findings reveal that conservatives’ desire for luxury goods stems from the goal of maintaining status and offer insights into how luxury brands can effectively tailor their communications to audiences with a conservative ideology.
","We examine the impact of social media on the decision-making process of a consumer’s purchase decision. We propose that social media (“social media”) positively influences the decision-making process of a consumer. Specifically, social media positively influences the decision-making process of a consumer who is motivated by social media (“social media”) and who is motivated by social media (“social media”) in a positive way. We find that social media positively influences the decision-making process of a consumer who is motivated by social media (“social media”) and who is motivated by social media (“social media”) in a negative way. We also find that social media positively influences the decision-making process of a consumer who is motivated by social media (“social media”) and who is motivated by social media (“social media”) in a positive way.

588,"Marketers often claim to be part of an exclusive tier (e.g., “top 10”) within their competitive set. Although recent behavioral research has investigated how consumers respond to rank claims, prior work has focused exclusively on claims having a numerical format. But marketers often communicate rankings using percentages (e.g., “top 20%”). The present research explores how using a numerical format claim (e.g., “top 10” out of 50 products) versus an equivalent percentage format claim (e.g., “top 20%” out of 50 products) influences consumer judgments. Across five experiments, the authors find robust evidence of a shift in evaluations whereby consumers respond more favorably to numerical rank claims when set sizes are smaller (i.e., <100) but more favorably to percentage rank claims when set sizes are larger (i.e., >100), even when the claims are mathematically equivalent. They further show that this change in evaluations occurs because consumers commit format neglect when making their evaluations by relying predominantly on the nominal value conveyed in a rank claim and insufficiently accounting for set size.
","We examine how the “price-for-performance” (PR) effect of a “price-for-performance” (PR) is affected by the “price-for-performance” effect of a “price-for-performance” (PR) that is not a price-for-performance effect. We find that PRs are more likely to be priced higher than other products, and that price-for-performance effects are more pronounced for products with higher prices. We also find that PRs are more likely to be priced lower than other products, and that price-for-performance effects are more pronounced for products with lower prices.

589,"The authors hypothesize that customer presence in the boardroom of business-to-business (B2B) firms brings customer orientation and customer knowledge to the board of directors and thereby enhances B2B firm performance. Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm. The authors also find that research and development intensity partially mediates the relationship between customer presence on the board and firm performance.

590,"Marketing managers and creatives alike believe that authenticity is an essential element for effective advertising. However, no common understanding of authenticity in advertising exists, and empirical knowledge about its impact on consumer behavior is limited. In this study, the authors use a comprehensive literature review and qualitative studies to identify four dimensions of authenticity in an advertising context. By examining 323 television ads across 67 brands and four years, they investigate these dimensions’ effects on the sales performance of advertised products. Because the impact of authenticity may depend on brand or product characteristics, the authors also analyze how these effects vary with brand size or across hedonic and utilitarian products. The results suggest that authenticity influences consumer behavior in a more nuanced manner than previously recognized. For instance, whereas an ad congruent with the brand’s essence has a positive effect on sales in most cases, an overly honest advertising message can actually hurt performance; the latter is true especially for hedonic products, for which consumers rely more on subjective information when making purchase decisions.

591,"This article uses multimethod approaches to develop a conceptual foundation for and empirical evidence of the performance implications of business-to-government (B2G) relationships. In-depth interviews reveal unique characteristics that differentiate B2G exchanges from commercial exchanges (e.g., procurement mission; regulations and oversight; scale, scope, and planning horizon) and highlight the resultant cost–benefit trade-offs for firms in this environment. Empirical longitudinal analyses of secondary data show that a firm’s government customer emphasis (firm revenue dependence on B2G relationships) exerts a positive nonlinear effect on firm value but also increases firm risk (idiosyncratic and systematic). Government customer breadth and depth are two critical customer portfolio characteristics that moderate these effects. High government customer breadth creates more costs associated with an increasing government customer emphasis, mitigating the positive nonlinear effect on firm value. However, breadth provides diversification benefits that alleviate the increase in idiosyncratic risk that comes with greater government customer emphasis. Deep B2G relationships give firms key customer domain knowledge and insights, which help counteract the increased idiosyncratic and systematic risks of government customer emphasis. The authors discuss the implications for marketing theory and practice.

592,"Managers often use popular events, such as the Olympics, to advertise their brands more heavily. Can manufacturers and retailers capitalize on these events to enhance the response to their price promotions? This study empirically examines whether the sales response to price promotions is stronger or weaker around events than at nonevent times, and what factors drive this relative promotion response. Studying 242 brands from 30 consumer packaged goods categories in the Netherlands over more than four years, the authors find that a price promotion offered around a popular event often generates a stronger sales response than the same promotion at nonevent times, with a price promotion elasticity that is 9.3% larger, on average, during events. Still, the variance in relative promotion response across brands and events is high, and the authors identify several drivers that managers should consider before shifting promotions toward event times.

593,"This research investigates the mechanism by which the aesthetic premium placed on produce contributes to consumers’ rejection of safe, edible, yet aesthetically unattractive, fruits and vegetables, which results in both financial loss to retailers and food waste. Further, the authors identify a novel way in which the devaluation of such produce can be reduced. Five experiments demonstrate that consumers devalue unattractive produce because of altered self-perceptions: merely imagining the consumption of unattractive produce negatively affects how consumers view themselves, lowering their willingness to pay for unattractive produce relative to equivalently safe but more attractive alternatives. This discrepancy in willingness to pay for unattractive versus attractive produce can be reduced by altering the self-diagnostic signal of consumer choices and boosting consumers’ self-esteem. An experiment in the field demonstrates the effectiveness of using easily implementable in-store messaging to boost consumers’ self-esteem in ways that increase consumers’ positive self-perceptions and, subsequently, their willingness to choose unattractive produce. This research, therefore, suggests low-cost yet effective strategies retailers can use to market unattractive produce, potentially raising retailer profits while reducing food waste.

594,"In business-to-business (B2B) markets, the success of key account management (KAM) teams depends on how they are structured and how they handle customer relationships. The authors conceptualize relationships among selling team members as a within-seller (intrafirm) network and the relationships between selling team members and buyer representatives as a buyer–seller (interfirm) network. Drawing on both structural (buyer–seller density, within-seller density, and within-seller centralization) and functional (buyer–seller similar function ties and within-seller cross-functional ties) composition attributes of these networks, the authors examine how the interplay between these networks drives seller account profitability. Using data from 207 key account managers across B2B industries, the authors uncover a nuanced pattern of interplay across the two networks. Densities in the two networks are mutually substitutive, but density in the buyer–seller networks and centralization in the within-seller networks serve complementary roles. Cross-function ties in the within-seller network serve a complementary role too, but only in relation to similar function ties in the buyer–seller network. In contrast, within-seller centralization supports both network density and similar function ties in the buyer–seller network and, thus, emerges as a valuable KAM team characteristic. These findings suggest multiple ways for firms to align interfirm and intrafirm KAM networks to improve account profitability.

595,"This research investigates how provision of calories-per-serving information on serving size labels affects snack consumption quantity. Drawing from expectancy-disconfirmation theory, this research shows that providing calories-per-serving information can ironically create a consumption backfire effect (consumers eat more when presented with calories-per-serving information) for snacks perceived as unhealthy but not for snacks perceived as healthy. The authors find that this effect arises when calorie expectations are higher than the posted calories-per-serving level—a frequent occurrence due to stated serving sizes that are typically smaller than amounts consumed in one sitting. The authors also show that attention to calorie information plays a key role such that the backfire effect occurs among consumers who pay more attention to calorie information. Furthermore, motivational factors including individual differences and perceptions of the risk associated with consuming a snack also play a role in driving consumption differences. The authors offer managerial, policy, and consumer welfare implications, including proposing and testing larger stated serving sizes as an intervention.

596,"Durable goods firms often create product lineups to provide a clear upgrading path as consumers make replacement decisions. Consumers can upgrade a little (i.e., spend a bit more than last time) or a lot (i.e., spend substantially more). However, the factors affecting the degree of such vertical “moving up” have received limited scholarly attention. In particular, little is known about how trade-in characteristics and the marginal costs–benefits of the new purchase influence the degree of upgrade. The authors use 320,000 Cash for Clunkers automobile transactions to provide the first examination of how mental accounting surpluses from trade-in ownership time and trade-in windfall, in addition to brand loyalty, affect the degree of upgrade. The authors find that trade-in ownership time and brand loyalty enhance the replacement’s degree of upgrade. However, trade-in windfall size has a negative effect, revealing the downside of this common promotional practice. Two experiments and additional dealer data indicate that this finding is robust to different economic conditions. Thus, these findings provide valuable new guidance for durable goods firms to facilitate the degree to which consumers upgrade.

597,"Increasingly, marketing activity is carried out within temporary organizations, whereby teams are assembled to complete a specific task within a predetermined time frame. Such organizations are uniquely suited to promoting various marketing outcomes but are not well understood. From a practical standpoint, their inherent characteristics create organizational challenges that, if not appropriately managed, can compromise performance. Drawing on agency theory and research on embedded ties, the authors conceptualize these challenges in terms of particular selection and enforcement problems. They identify three forms of temporary marketing organizations that vary in their selection and enforcement qualities. Next, the authors develop a conceptual framework that shows the selection and enforcement implications of a temporary organization’s task, timeline, and team composition. They also demonstrate that selection and enforcement mechanisms have portable qualities and can be “imported” to a given temporary organization, from either a prior temporary organization or a larger permanent one.

598,"In recent years, many news providers have begun monetizing online content through paywalls. While the premise behind paywalls is that the subscription revenue can be a new source of income, the externalities that might arise from this pricing change are unclear. The authors study two potential externalities of newspaper paywalls: (1) the effect of a paywall on the engagement of its online reader base and (2) the spillover effect on the print version of the newspaper. The engagement effect considers how the paywall altered the various engagement metrics among light and heavy readers of online news. The spillover effect is likely to arise if readers view print and online versions of a newspaper as substitutes, implying that increasing the price of the latter is likely to increase the demand for the former. Moreover, many newspaper paywalls offer bundles wherein print subscribers are provided free access to the online newspaper. Therefore, the value that a reader derives from the print subscription could be higher after the erection of the paywall. As a result, paywalls are likely to have a positive spillover effect on print subscription and, consequently, circulation. The authors document the sizes of the two externalities for the New York Times paywall and compare them with the direct subscription revenue generated. They comment on implications for newspapers and online content providers that are seeking mechanisms to monetize digital content.

599,"This article examines market scoping for early-stage technologies, a fundamental yet underexplored marketing activity. Market scoping refers to managerial activities directed at the identification of market spaces for early-stage technologies. This discovery-oriented research aimed at theory development draws on an extensive, multiyear database of email trails and archival records detailing market-scoping efforts for early-stage technologies emerging from a global research university. From this longitudinal database, the authors provide an in-depth examination of managers’ market space decisions and advance an initial theory of market scoping. They isolate managers’ market-scoping mindset—which manifests as market ambiguity avoidance or acceptance—as a key explanatory construct shaping market space decisions and outcomes. Market ambiguity avoidance results in managers’ downstream orientation toward end users; this mindset, counterintuitively, may lead to technology commercialization failure. In contrast, market ambiguity acceptance results in managers’ upstream orientation; this mindset directs attention away from end users but helps uncover indirect paths to viable market spaces. This article lays the groundwork for advancing marketing research in the context of early-stage technology commercialization.

600,"Seeded marketing campaigns (SMCs) have become part of the marketing mix for many fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. In addition to making large investments in advertising and sales promotions, these firms now encourage seed agents or microinfluencers to discuss brands with friends and acquaintances to create further value. It is thus critical to understand how an FMCG seeding program interacts with traditional marketing tools when estimating the effectiveness of such efforts. However, the issue is still underexplored. The authors present the first empirical analysis of this question using a rich data set collected on four brands from various European FMCG markets. They combine advertising and sales promotion data from FMCG brand managers with sales and retail variables from market research companies as well as firm-created word-of-mouth variables from SMC agencies. The authors analyze the data using several approaches, confronting challenges of endogeneity and multicollinearity. They consistently find that firm-created word of mouth through SMC programs interacts negatively with all tested forms of advertising but positively with promotional activities. This phenomenon has significant implications for understanding the utility of SMCs and how they should be managed. The analysis implies that SMCs may increase total sales by approximately 3%–18% throughout the campaigns.

601,"The advertising industry has recently witnessed proliferation in native ads, which are inserted into a web stream (e.g., a list of news articles or social media posts) and look like the surrounding nonsponsored contents. This study is among the first to examine native ads and unveil how their effectiveness changes across serial positions by analyzing a large-scale data set with 120 ads. For each ad, the authors use separate “natural experiment” studies to compare the ad’s performance as its serial position varies. Subsequently, they conduct a meta-analysis to generalize the results across all studies. The results reveal vastly asymmetric effects of native ad serial position on publishers’ metrics (click-based) versus advertisers’ metrics (conversion-based). As serial position lowers (i.e., from rank 1 to a lower rank), there are only modest changes in publishers’ metrics, but drastic reductions in advertisers’. This pattern is unique to native ads and has not been indicated by prior research on ad serial position. Moreover, the authors show the moderating effects of audience gender and age. The findings provide new and timely implications for researchers and marketers.

602,"Creating effective online customer experiences through well-designed product web pages is critical to success in online retailing. How such web pages should look specifically, however, remains unclear. Previous work has only addressed a few online design elements in isolation, without accounting for the potential need to adjust experiences to reflect the characteristics of the products or brands being sold. Across 16 experiments, this research investigates how 13 unique design elements shape four dimensions of the online customer experience (informativeness, entertainment, social presence, and sensory appeal) and thus influence purchase. Product (search vs. experience) and brand (trustworthiness) characteristics exacerbate or mitigate the uncertainty inherent in online shopping, such that they moderate the influence of each experience dimension on purchases. A field experiment that manipulates real product pages on Amazon.com affirms these findings. The results thus provide managers with clear strategic guidance on how to build effective web pages.

603,"Social comparisons among suppliers connected through a common retailer pose significant management challenges for the retailer. For instance, a focal supplier’s social comparison can result in upward or downward referent discrepancy, decreasing or increasing perceptions of distributive fairness, respectively, subject to the tie strength of the relationship. Because decreasing perceptions of distributive fairness can be harmful to the retailer–supplier relationship, the authors examine the use of tie strength and timing of explanations as actions a retailer can take to mitigate such perceptions. They test their hypotheses with a two-study, multimethod design conducted in Japan. Study 1 employs a survey of suppliers in a store-within-a-store context as well as objective performance data. The results indicate that upward (downward) referent discrepancy decreases (increases) a focal supplier’s perceptions of distributive fairness. Study 2 employs an experiment using brand/store managers. The results show that when upward referent discrepancies are present, retailers can mitigate the invidious effects of decreased perceptions of distributive fairness by developing strong ties and enacting procedurally fair policies such as proactively providing explanations.

604,"Firms increasingly use innovation tournaments to crowdsource innovation ideas from customers. This article uncovers antecedents and consequences of customers’ participation intensity over the course of a tournament. More specifically, the authors theorize on the effects that the type and timing of moderating feedback have on tournament participants’ participation intensity, as well as the effect of the latter on idea quality. Through two longitudinal experiments using a commercial innovation tournament platform, the authors show that moderating feedback stimulates ideators’ participation intensity. They find that negative feedback increases participation intensity, as compared to no feedback and positive feedback. Moreover, negative feedback, either provided in isolation or together with positive feedback, is more effective during the early stages than in the later stages of a tournament. Using a large-scale managerial survey, the authors show that higher participation intensity leads to higher idea quality and better business performance. The effect of participation intensity on idea quality is stronger than the effect of number of ideas and as strong as the effect of number of participants on idea quality.

605,"Online firestorms pose severe threats to online brand communities. Any negative electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has the potential to become an online firestorm, yet not every post does, so finding ways to detect and respond to negative eWOM constitutes a critical managerial priority. The authors develop a comprehensive framework that integrates different drivers of negative eWOM and the response approaches that firms use to engage in and disengage from online conversations with complaining customers. A text-mining study of negative eWOM demonstrates distinct impacts of high- and low-arousal emotions, structural tie strength, and linguistic style match (between sender and brand community) on firestorm potential. The firm’s response must be tailored to the intensity of arousal in the negative eWOM to limit the virality of potential online firestorms. The impact of initiated firestorms can be mitigated by distinct firm responses over time, and the effectiveness of different disengagement approaches also varies with their timing. For managers, these insights provide guidance on how to detect and reduce the virality of online firestorms.

606,"Highlighting the important role of marketing in encouraging sustainable consumption, the current research presents a review of the academic literature from marketing and behavioral science that examines the most effective ways to shift consumer behaviors to be more sustainable. In the process of the review, the authors develop a comprehensive framework for conceptualizing and encouraging sustainable consumer behavior change. The framework is represented by the acronym SHIFT, and it proposes that consumers are more inclined to engage in pro-environmental behaviors when the message or context leverages the following psychological factors: Social influence, Habit formation, Individual self, Feelings and cognition, and Tangibility. The authors also identify five broad challenges to encouraging sustainable behaviors and use these to develop novel theoretical propositions and directions for future research. Finally, the authors outline how practitioners aiming to encourage sustainable consumer behaviors can use this framework.

607,"Brand sponsorship connects brands with large, passionate audiences. The sponsorship literature emphasizes the importance of brand sponsor–team congruence; however, prior research has largely focused on the relevance of the brand to the sport or geographic area. This article offers the first real-world empirical investigation of the effects of visual congruence through color matching on sponsorship performance. A wide-scale study of 703 Major League Baseball fans’ evaluations of their team’s sponsors, merged with real stadium signage data, offers evidence of the benefits of visual congruence. Two experiments in the contexts of product packaging and online advertising provide converging evidence of the positive effects of created visual congruence on attitudes toward the sponsorship, brand attitudes, and intentions. Brands without an inherent match to a team can enjoy enhanced sponsorship benefits with little additional costs simply by adopting the team’s colors in visual displays. However, the viewer’s motivation (fan status), opportunity (fan exposure), and ability (lack of color blindness) to process visual congruence moderates its effectiveness. By using the proposed framework, managers can maximize the value of their sponsorship rights.

608,"Market intelligence is a cornerstone of the marketing concept and essential to market-focused strategic planning and implementation. Although the importance of market intelligence is widely accepted, how managers can ensure the organization-wide generation, dissemination, and responsiveness to market intelligence remains a persistent challenge. In this article, the authors investigate market intelligence dissemination practices and their resulting managerial responses. Using qualitative methods, the authors identify five market intelligence dissemination practices that either update and reinforce organization members’ existing schemas (mental models) of the market or create new, shared schemas of the market. Specifically, they find that the creation, existence, or absence of organizationally shared market schemas is crucial in explaining the effectiveness of different market intelligence dissemination practices. Thus, in addition to being experts on market intelligence, intelligence directors must be authorities on organizational learning and ways to create shared meaning structures that enable disseminated intelligence to be understood and used within their organizations. The authors conclude with suggestions for practitioners on how to manage intelligence dissemination across their organizations more effectively and efficiently.

609,"This article evaluates when a user-design approach is and is not effective in strengthening brand preference. It specifically delves into the role of power-distance beliefs in influencing preferences for user-designed products and brands. The authors demonstrate that low-power-distance consumers prefer user-designed products to company-designed products, whereas this effect is attenuated or reversed for high-power-distance consumers. The authors find process evidence that both feelings of empowerment and values of expertise differentially mediate brand preferences depending on power-distance beliefs, thus extending prior research findings. Field experiments conducted in the United States and cross-culturally (Austria and Guatemala) with Facebook’s advertising platform provide convergent evidence using country and political orientation as managerially accessible proxies. This research sheds light on when and why firms should be wary of user-design approaches, based on how power-distance beliefs drive consumers’ preferences.

610,"Firms sometimes engage in myopic management (e.g., cutting marketing spending, providing lenient credit to customers to improve short-term results). Although marketing is at the center of such myopic management, there are few insights on whether a marketing department could prevent it. To address this gap, the authors examine the role of powerful marketing departments in preventing myopic marketing spending and revenue management. They hypothesize that there are internal and external enablers of marketing department power (i.e., a chief executive officer with marketing experience, the firm’s power over its customers, analyst coverage, and institutional stock ownership) that help a powerful marketing department prevent myopic management. They test the hypotheses using a panel of 781 publicly listed U.S. firms between 2000 and 2015. As hypothesized, when the firm has (1) a chief executive officer with a marketing background and (2) power over its customers, increasing marketing department power decreases the likelihood of both myopic marketing spending and myopic revenue management; increasing marketing department power and analyst coverage decreases the likelihood of myopic marketing spending. The findings highlight powerful marketing leadership as a hitherto overlooked way to prevent myopic management and improve firm performance.

611,"Several manufacturers make substantial investments to compete in sports contests, using the gear they develop and market. However, no systematic analysis of the breeding (i.e., innovation) and branding (i.e., marketing) returns from such investments exists. In this study, the authors conceptualize and empirically estimate the breeding and branding returns that such manufacturers obtain. The authors gather data for 30 car brands of 16 manufacturers over the period 2000–2015 regarding their participation, spending, and performance in Formula One championships, annual patent citations, and research-and-development (R&D) budgets as well as monthly vehicle registrations, advertising expenditures, and Formula One TV viewership. The authors find that only gear manufacturers with relatively high levels of R&D spending obtain a positive and significant breeding return from competing in sports contests. While most brands obtain positive branding returns, the lower the level of advertising spending for the brand, the greater the branding returns they obtain from competing in these contests. Thus, research-intense (compared with advertising-intense) gear manufacturers have more to gain from competing in sports contests. These findings can help guide manufacturers in budget allocation decisions on sports competitions, R&D, and advertising.
",We examine the impact of the sale of a large number of high-quality brands on the sales of a large number of high-quality brands. We use a panel data set of the U.S. retail industry to examine the impact of the sale of a large number of high-quality brands on the sales of a large number of high-quality brands. We find that the sale of a large number of high-quality brands leads to a significant increase in sales of high-quality brands. We also find that the sale of a large number of high-quality brands leads to a significant decrease in sales of high-quality brands. We also find that the sale of a large number of high-quality brands leads to a significant increase in sales of high-quality brands.

612,"Globalization has substantially influenced the world economy. However, managers have a limited understanding of how local–global identity influences consumers’ price perceptions and behavior. In this research, the authors propose that consumers’ local (vs. global) identity leads to a greater tendency to make price–perceived quality (PPQ) associations. Perceived quality variance among comparison brands is a key mechanism underlying these effects. Two field studies (Studies 1 and 7), seven experiments (Studies 2–6, 9, and 10), and a systematic review of secondary data (Study 8) provide converging and robust evidence for the effect of local–global identity on PPQ. Consistent with the perceived quality variance account, when quality differences among the brands are made salient, PPQ associations of consumers high in global (but not local) identity significantly increase, compared with baseline conditions. However, when perceived quality similarities are made salient, PPQ associations of consumers high in local (but not global) identity significantly decrease. Product type and distribution of customer ratings represent natural boundaries for the relationship between local–global identity and PPQ. The authors conclude with the implications for managers’ targeting endeavors. We also provide specific tools that marketers can use in ads and point-of-purchase materials to encourage or discourage consumers in making PPQ associations.
","We examine the impact of consumer preferences on the likelihood of a product’s market share (i.e., the likelihood of a product being sold to consumers) and the likelihood of a product’s market share (i.e., the likelihood of a product being sold to consumers) on the likelihood of a product’s market share (i.e., the likelihood of a product being sold to consumers).

613,"The authors test five theoretically derived hypotheses about what drives video ad sharing across multiple social media platforms. Two independent field studies test these hypotheses using 11 emotions and over 60 ad characteristics. The results are consistent with theory and robust across studies. Information-focused content has a significantly negative effect on sharing, except in risky contexts. Positive emotions of amusement, excitement, inspiration, and warmth positively affect sharing. Various drama elements such as surprise, plot, and characters, including babies, animals, and celebrities arouse emotions. Prominent (early vs. late, long vs. short duration, persistent vs. pulsing) placement of brand names hurts sharing. Emotional ads are shared more on general platforms (Facebook, Google+, Twitter) than on LinkedIn, and the reverse holds for informational ads. Sharing is also greatest when ad length is moderate (1.2 to 1.7 minutes). Contrary to these findings, ads use information more than emotions, celebrities more than babies or animals, prominent brand placement, little surprise, and very short or very long ads. A third study shows that the identified drivers predict sharing accurately in an entirely independent sample.

614,"Recycling campaigns abound, but do consumers think about what becomes of those recyclables? This research proposes that product transformation salience (thinking about recyclables turning into new products) increases recycling. The authors theorize that consumers are inspired by the transformation of recyclables into new products and that this inspiration motivates them to recycle. The authors demonstrate the effect of product transformation messages on recycling behavior using a recycling campaign (Study 1) and advertisements for products made from recycled plastic (Study 2). Study 3 demonstrates the mediating role of inspiration. Then, three field studies provide robust support for the transformation salience effect through click-through rates for recycling advertisements (Study 4), recycling rates during pre–football game tailgating (Study 5), and a reduction in the amount of recyclable materials incorrectly placed in the landfill bin by students in a university residence hall (Study 6). The authors discuss implications for the design of recycling campaigns and positioning of recycled products in the marketplace as well as theoretical contributions regarding the roles of transformation salience and inspiration in encouraging recycling and other sustainable behaviors.

615,"Despite the growing popularity of cocreation approaches to innovation, the bottom-line results of these efforts continue to frustrate many firms. Marketing communications are one important tool in stimulating consumer adoption, yet marketers to date have not taken advantage of a unique phenomenon associated with many cocreated innovations: the presence of a genesis story in the words of the creator, which can be combined in different ways with traditional marketing messaging. Using mixed methods, the authors demonstrate a crossover effect in which a “mismatch” of the fundamental motivations behind authentic creation narratives and traditional persuasive messages enhances adoption of the cocreated innovation. This effect is mediated by potential adopters’ self-referencing of their own stories about similar experiences or consumption episodes. Furthermore, the effect of a motivation mismatch strategy is attenuated for expert consumers. Finally, this motivation mismatch strategy triggers “takeoff” of cocreated innovations. This research offers substantial implications for research on cocreated innovation, narrative persuasion, and firm-generated and user-generated communication. It provides managers specific guidance on enhancing the success of cocreation programs through an integrated communications strategy.

616,"Shareholder complaints put pressure on publicly listed firms, yet firms rarely directly address the actual issues raised in these complaints. The authors examine whether firms respond in an alternative way by altering advertising investments in an effort to ward off the financial damage associated with shareholder complaints. By analyzing a unique data set of shareholder complaints submitted to S&P 1500 firms between 2001 and 2016, supplemented with qualitative interviews of executives of publicly listed firms, the authors document that firms increase advertising investments following shareholder complaints and that such an advertising investment response mitigates a postcomplaint decline in firm value. Furthermore, results suggest that firms are more likely to increase advertising investments when shareholder complaints are submitted by institutional investors, pertain to nonfinancial concerns, and relate to topics that receive high media attention. The findings provide new insights on how firms address stock market adversities with advertising investments and inform managers about the effectiveness of such a response.

617,"This study aims to deepen the understanding of evaluating TV ad spots by their immediate effects on important online activities. The authors merged minute-by-minute brand search and price search data with spot-level TV advertisement data for the three leading pickup truck brands in the United States over an 11-month period. They presented a generalizable modeling framework and used it to estimate the size and variation of immediate online responses to TV ads. The average elasticity of brand search to a brand’s own national ads is .09, and the average elasticity of price search to a brand’s own national ads is .03. Given ad audience size, immediate search responses vary with ad creative characteristics, audience category interest, slot of the break, program genre, and time factors. Overall, the results show that ordinary TV ads lead to a variety of immediate online responses and that advertisers can use these signals to enrich their media planning and campaign evaluations.

618,"Power theories (e.g., social exchange theory, resource dependence theory) and efficiency theories (e.g., transaction cost analysis) offer very different perspectives on the design of contractual governance in marketing channels. Whereas power theory suggests that governance will reflect the preferences of powerful firms, efficiency theories argue that governance will maximize joint value. In this research, the authors provide an integrative framework that reconciles power and efficiency perspectives in the context of contractual marketing channel relationships. This framework discriminates between two methods of exercising power: ex ante (through a tightly specified, efficient contract that rewards the powerful firm through the price mechanism while providing strong safeguards for the weak firm) or ex post (through a loosely specified, inefficient contract that allows the powerful firm to exploit its power during renegotiations). The authors argue that power will cause channel governance to deviate from the efficient choice, but only to the extent that the powerful firm cannot price out (i.e., extract) the value it offers to the weaker firm ex ante. As exchange conditions become more uncertain, power will demonstrate stronger effects on governance. This theory is supported with data from studies on contractual research-and-development relationships and procurement contracts for customized industrial products.

619,"While temperature’s effects on human physiology have been well studied, its effects in decision-making contexts are still relatively unknown. The authors investigate the role of ambient temperature in one important decision-making context: consumer purchase. More specifically, they examine how ambient temperature influences consumers’ willingness to pay in different kinds of purchase contexts, such as in auctions and in negotiations. The authors show that whereas higher (vs. moderate) temperatures elicit higher willingness to pay in auctions, they lead to a lower willingness to pay in negotiations, and temperature-induced discomfort and aggression underlie these effects. The authors also study the effects of lower temperatures and extend these findings to more general competitive settings. They report findings from six studies and discuss theoretical, managerial, and policy implications.
","We examine the effects of consumer choice on the performance of a consumer’s choice of products. We find that consumers’ choice of products is affected by the consumer’s choice of the product’s price and the consumer’s choice of the product’s price. We find that consumers’ choice of products is affected by the consumer’s choice of the product’s price and the consumer’s choice of the product’s price. We also find that consumers’ choice of products is affected by the consumer’s choice of the product’s price and the consumer’s choice of the product�s price. These findings are consistent with the view that consumers’ choice of products is influenced by the consumer’s choice of the product’s price.This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, behavioral economics.  \  \  \  \  \  \  \ 2017  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \",0.106237546,-0.65148807,-0.7325138,-0.85608345,-0.138243,-0.68084705,0.0809128,1.2184535,1.3929985,0.677486,-0.11604154,0.1303984,-1.8086516,-1.2449551,0.269449,0.63979375,-0.50605565,0.98947483,0.31956062,0.41432953,-1.817209,0.78290135,0.13134699,-0.34742668,-0.5600766,-0.04890486,1.1820865,-0.55510545,-0.558437,-0.09332347,-0.22106113,0.5465166,-0.348336,-1.9711108,-0.75549436,1.2964927,0.04561384,-0.43944886,-0.027895957,0.058815576,-0.22851169,0.036646117,0.6406435,-0.5216307,-1.0372686,-0.04988353,-0.07647192,-0.9667836,0.5038325,0.21923783,-0.2973076,-0.64593613,-1.0071607,0.100447625,0.10706126,-0.44200486,0.64288193,0.007944616,0.37496954,0.5245116,-0.49443135,0.4108582,-0.12711135,0.13347742,1.2354289,0.5746877,0.10406034,-1.3051438,0.6061361,-0.5098712,0.015765307,1.5743654,1.4159576,-1.516571,-0.55116457,0.0026628347,-0.65651596,0.6604279,-0.06096887,-0.59775305,3.0374491,-0.3951084,0.81877816,0.27851936,0.6582479,-0.13181007,-0.8975095,-1.0124665,-0.27834925,0.7094001,1.011706,1.2526047,-1.8060919,-0.59874946,0.5761825,0.4151271,-0.15638801,-0.36389992,0.22733666,0.9635245,0.88100225,0.95079505,0.8759772,1.5796986,0.29116982,0.8227984,-0.6422183,0.046730373,0.5367784,0.35552847,0.82480574,0.62486666,1.1882412,0.18191873,-0.18754391,0.30397406,-0.38345513,1.1732922,1.1531819,0.08259217,-0.55088097,0.5293603,0.55977553,-0.116334006,-1.3359708,-0.0067751985,0.1278168,-1.048235
620,"The last decade has seen the emergence of the sharing economy as well as the rise of a diverse array of research on this topic both inside and outside the marketing discipline. However, the sharing economy’s implications for marketing thought and practice remain unclear. This article defines the sharing economy as a technologically enabled socioeconomic system with five key characteristics (i.e., temporary access, transfer of economic value, platform mediation, expanded consumer role, and crowdsourced supply). It also examines the sharing economy’s impact on marketing’s traditional beliefs and practices in terms of how it challenges three key foundations of marketing: institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), processes (e.g., innovation, branding, customer experience, value appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society) and offers future research directions designed to push the boundaries of marketing thought. The article concludes with a set of forward-looking guideposts that highlight the implications of the sharing economy’s paradoxes, maturation, and technological development for marketing research. Collectively, this article aims to help marketing scholars not only keep pace with the sharing economy but also shape its future direction.
","The digital transformation of the economy has been a major driver of the growth of digital entrepreneurship. However, the digital transformation of the economy has also been a major driver of the growth of digital entrepreneurship. In this paper, we examine the role of digital entrepreneurship in the emergence of digital entrepreneurship in the context of the digital transformation of the economy. We develop a theoretical framework to understand the role of digital entrepreneurship in the emergence of digital entrepreneurship and the emergence of digital entrepreneurship in the context of the digital transformation of the economy. We develop a model of digital entrepreneurship that incorporates the characteristics of digital entrepreneurship and the characteristics of digital entrepreneurship. We find that digital entrepreneurship is a phenomenon that is characterized by a high level of innovation, a high level of innovation intensity, and a high level of innovation intensity. We also find that digital entrepreneurship is characterized by a high level of innovation intensity and a high level of innovation intensity. We also find that digital entrepreneurship is characterized by a high level of innovation intensity and a high level of innovation intensity.

621,"Marketers strive to create cool brands, but the literature does not offer a blueprint for what “brand coolness” means or what features characterize cool brands. This research uses a mixed-methods approach to conceptualize brand coolness and identify a set of characteristics typically associated with cool brands. Focus groups, depth interviews, and an essay study indicate that cool brands are perceived to be extraordinary, aesthetically appealing, energetic, high status, rebellious, original, authentic, subcultural, iconic, and popular. In nine quantitative studies (surveys and experiments), the authors develop scale items to reliably measure the component characteristics of brand coolness; show that brand coolness influences important outcome variables, including consumers’ attitudes toward, satisfaction with, intentions to talk about, and willingness to pay for the brand; and demonstrate how cool brands change over time. At first, most brands become cool to a small niche, at which point they are perceived to be more subcultural, rebellious, authentic, and original. Over time, some cool brands become adopted by the masses, at which point they are perceived to be more popular and iconic.

622,"Subscription-based service providers (e.g., newspapers, internet services) often issue price-based incentives to recover from service failures. However, because considerable time may pass between when providers issue a recovery incentive and when service contracts are due for renewal, it is unclear whether recovery incentives can improve customer retention in the long run. The authors investigate this question by examining 6,919 contract renewal decisions of newspaper subscribers who received varying levels of recovery incentives after newspaper delivery failures. In contrast to conventional wisdom, they find that recovery incentives are associated with lower contract renewal likelihoods. They rationalize this finding using the economic theory of reference prices and further demonstrate that firms could mitigate the unintended consequence of recovery incentives by reminding subscribers of the original price at touch points following the recovery, discounting the renewal price, and prolonging the duration between the recovery and renewal. The authors also show that the intensity of promotions in the external environment at the time of administering recovery incentives, and that acquiring subscribers by communicating the value of the subscription service, can influence the long-term effectiveness of recovery incentives. For subscription-based service providers, the authors propose a decision support model to optimize recovery and renewal incentives and demonstrate its utility within this empirical context.

623,"Influencer marketing is prevalent in firm strategies, yet little is known about the factors that drive success of online brand engagement at different stages of the consumer purchase funnel. The findings suggest that sponsored blogging affects online engagement (e.g., posting comments, liking a brand) differently depending on blogger characteristics and blog post content, which are further moderated by social media platform type and campaign advertising intent. When a sponsored post occurs on a blog, high blogger expertise is more effective when the advertising intent is to raise awareness versus increase trial. However, source expertise fails to drive engagement when the sponsored post occurs on Facebook. When a sponsored post occurs on Facebook, posts high in hedonic content are more effective when the advertising intent is to increase trial versus raise awareness. The effectiveness of campaign incentives depends on the platform type, such that they can increase (decrease) engagement on blogs (Facebook). The empirical evidence for these findings comes from real in-market customer response data and is supplemented with data from an experiment. Taken together, the findings highlight the critical interplay of platform type, campaign intent, source, campaign incentives, and content factors in driving engagement.

624,"Many markets are liberalizing by opening up their economies to foreign competition, with the expectation that this will increase economic growth. While foreign competitors with superior technology and management practices pose serious threats to incumbent firms, they also provide them an opportunity to gain new marketing knowledge. How do incumbent firms respond to liberalization? Can incumbent firms’ marketing-mix responses affect their performance following liberalization? Addressing these questions, the authors examine incumbent firms’ marketing-mix responses to liberalization and the impact of these responses on performance, using the quasi-experiment of liberalization reforms in India. Estimation results from a panel of 3,927 firms in the period 1989–2000 suggest that while all incumbent firms intensified their product and promotions in response to liberalization, only incumbent firms with greater domestic market knowledge intensified their advertising and distribution responses. Furthermore, incumbent firms’ marketing-mix responses significantly affect their performance outcomes. The research’s findings extend theory and provide practical guidelines on how incumbent firms can design marketing-mix responses to liberalization to improve performance.

625,"Gift giving is an effective means to strengthen interpersonal relationships; it also may initiate and enhance customer–brand relationships. Through a field study conducted with an international monobrand retailer of beauty products, a combination of propensity score matching with difference-in-differences estimations, and two experimental scenario studies, this research demonstrates that gift buyers spend 63% more in the year following a gift purchase than a matched sample of customers who purchase for their personal use. Specifically, gift buyers increase their purchase frequency (25%), spend more per shopping trip (41%), and engage in more cross-buying (49%). The sales lift is particularly pronounced among new customers. Identity theory suggests customer gratitude and public commitment as mediating mechanisms. Gift purchase design characteristics (i.e., assistance during gift purchase and branded gift wrapping) influence the strength of the mediating mechanisms.
","We propose that the relationship between customer satisfaction and purchase intentions is mediated by the relationship between customer satisfaction and purchase intentions. We propose that customer satisfaction is positively related to purchase intentions and that purchase intentions are positively related to customer satisfaction. We test our hypotheses using a longitudinal data set of 1,973 customers who completed a survey of their purchase intentions. We find that customer satisfaction is positively related to purchase intentions and that purchase intentions are positively related to customer satisfaction. We find that customer satisfaction is positively related to purchase intentions and that purchase intentions are positively related to customer satisfaction. We find that customer satisfaction is positively related to purchase intentions and that purchase intentions are positively related to customer satisfaction.

626,"Many firms introduce both business-to-business service innovations (B2B-SIs) and business-to-consumer service innovations (B2C-SIs) and need to better allocate their resources. However, they are unsure about B2B-SIs’ effects on firm value or risk, especially relative to those of B2C-SIs. The authors address this problem by developing hypotheses that relate the number of B2B-SIs and B2C-SIs to firm value and firm risk together with the moderators (the number of product innovations and customer-focus innovations). To test the hypotheses, the authors develop and estimate a model using unique panel data of 2,263 SIs across 15 industries over eight years assembled from multiple data sources and controlling for firm- and market-specific factors, heterogeneity, and endogeneity. They analyze innovation announcements using natural language processing. The results show that B2B-SIs have a positive effect on firm value and an insignificant influence on firm risk. Importantly, the effect of a B2B-SI on firm value is significantly greater than that of a B2C-SI. Unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is greater when the firm has more product innovations. Surprisingly, unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is less positive when the SIs emphasize customers. These findings offer important insights about the relative value of B2B-SIs.
","We examine the impact of product-specific information technology (IT) on firm performance. We find that the presence of IT in a firm’s product portfolio is associated with a positive (positive) relationship with firm performance. The positive relationship is stronger for firms with high-tech (high-tech) products, which are more likely to be profitable. The negative relationship is stronger for firms with low-tech products, which are more likely to be profitable. We also find that the presence of IT in a firm’s product portfolio is associated with a positive (negative) relationship with firm performance. The positive relationship is stronger for firms with high-tech products, which are more likely to be profitable. The negative relationship is stronger for firms with low-tech products, which are more likely to be profitable. We also find that the presence of IT in a firm’s product portfolio is associated with a positive (negative) relationship with firm performance. The positive relationship is stronger for firms with high-tech products, which are more likely to be profitable. We also find that the presence of IT in a firm’s product portfolio is associated with a positive (negative) relationship with firm performance.

627,"In business-to-government and business-to-business transactions, suppliers often have limited access to buyers during the buying process. The authors term these buyers “barricaded buyers.” Despite the prevalence of barricaded buyers in practice, research has remained largely silent on the topic. Therefore, the authors combine insights from eight organizational purchasing case studies and individual interviews with signaling theory to advance a conceptual framework that highlights ways a supplier can increase its competitiveness (and, correspondingly, its selection likelihood) when selling to barricaded buyers. The framework reflects three distinct ways in which signaling occurs or influences the barricaded buying process: the seller signals to buyers (e.g., through novel solutions, explicit responding), the seller signals to competing sellers (e.g., through peacocking), and the buyer signals to sellers whose meaning is jammed (e.g., through supplier-specific capabilities and language). The framework invokes barricade restrictiveness as an important contingency variable that lends nuance to when the signaling activities are most likely to affect suppliers’ competitiveness.
","We study the impact of a firm’s strategic positioning on the supply chain and the supply chain’s competitive advantage. We examine the impact of strategic positioning on the supply chain’s competitive advantage by examining the relationship between the firm’s strategic positioning and the supply chain’s competitive advantage. We find that strategic positioning is associated with a higher supply chain’s competitive advantage, whereas supply chain positioning is associated with a lower supply chain’s competitive advantage. We also find that strategic positioning is associated with a lower supply chain’s competitive advantage, whereas supply chain positioning is associated with a higher supply chain’s competitive advantage. We also find that strategic positioning is associated with a lower supply chain’s competitive advantage, whereas supply chain positioning is associated with a higher supply chain’s competitive advantage. We discuss the implications of these findings for the literature on supply chain competition and supply chain strategy.  We discuss the implications of these findings for supply chain strategy and supply chain strategy.  We discuss the implications of these findings for the literature on supply chain competition and supply chain strategy.This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, information systems.  10/29/17  \  11",0.6093437,-0.65442157,-0.69405156,0.15664774,0.57396126,-0.4660462,-0.5113022,1.3245423,0.96441084,-0.024293363,-0.16883156,0.122114435,-0.21486473,0.3456936,-0.380317,0.69829476,-0.4495835,0.21815385,0.5719977,0.52394515,0.12428248,-0.5988291,-0.22524299,0.5043153,-0.7267003,0.37087467,1.7038225,0.4313494,0.09678641,0.22455284,-0.25161573,0.29478478,-0.71255994,-2.2508276,-0.8201887,0.30647758,0.068565406,0.23974977,-1.2610962,-0.032306984,0.29990712,0.54466623,0.23043199,-0.22755685,-0.20448807,-0.75875366,0.10954482,0.10500193,-0.44332126,0.33852297,0.86924356,-0.14472724,-0.21037003,-1.0065134,-0.96046835,-0.16364165,0.7301466,0.77912706,0.2628351,-0.2622685,-0.22970054,1.5258867,-0.4535062,0.52908045,0.9617135,0.5305353,0.22386618,-0.8327653,-0.6048997,0.49589854,-0.7495427,0.27897704,1.5697185,-0.994343,0.32753938,-0.03340355,-0.5635756,0.37800726,-0.56409246,-0.41536957,0.020427331,-1.2582761,-0.6042357,0.19896537,0.2644777,1.7963201,0.562753,-0.88097346,-1.4296551,0.027821412,0.43276352,0.18825749,-0.29431763,-0.8299642,-0.5724452,-1.1101822,0.45815086,-0.54364777,0.9657912,0.009783788,0.38418782,-0.05454385,0.79994816,-0.5583624,-0.9751986,0.36264136,-1.6464514,0.44698834,0.066603675,0.4961898,-0.10861835,1.1062448,1.3977666,0.8372328,-0.00876333,0.07067729,-0.48235267,0.62211007,-0.012273321,2.362033,-1.1567974,-0.102999814,-0.27631447,-0.4232337,-0.91462636,-0.41376597,-0.060961645,-1.1652577
628,"Despite the demonstrated importance of customer sentiment in social media for outcomes such as purchase behavior and of firms’ increasing use of customer engagement initiatives, surprisingly few studies have investigated firms’ ability to influence the sentiment of customers’ digital engagement. Many firms track buyers’ offline interactions, design online content to coincide with customers’ experiences, and face varied performance during events, enabling the modification of marketer-generated content to correspond to the event outcomes. This study examines the role of firms’ social media engagement initiatives surrounding customers’ experiential interaction events in influencing the sentiment of customers’ digital engagement. Results indicate that marketers can influence the sentiment of customers’ digital engagement beyond their performance during customers’ interactions, and for unfavorable event outcomes, informational marketer-generated content, more so than emotional content, can enhance customer sentiment.

629,"Users of deal collectives coproduce “deals” that yield value beyond what a marketer intends when offering promotions. The authors develop an understanding of how this unintended value is coproduced through the combined actions of users in deal collectives. Users are drawn to deal collectives by a web of motivations that include subversive shopper feelings, which reflect a desire to outsmart firms and temporarily upend the market power structure. Uncovered transvaluation processes show that deal forums—due to their collective knowledge, creativity, and trust—are more effective than individual consumers at identifying, developing, and vetting opportunities to capture unintended value. The authors further reveal that unintended value can stem from untargeted promotions, pricing and promotion errors, and combinations or stacking of promotions. Strategies for monitoring deal collectives and either discouraging or supporting their activities are offered.

630,"Companies frequently offer product recommendations to customers, according to various algorithms. This research explores how companies should frame the methods they use to derive their recommendations, in an attempt to maximize click-through rates. Two common framings—user-based and item-based—might describe the same recommendation. User-based framing emphasizes the similarity between customers (e.g., “People who like this also like…”); item-based framing instead emphasizes similarities between products (e.g., “Similar to this item”). Six experiments, including two field experiments within a mobile app, show that framing the same recommendation as user-based (vs. item-based) can increase recommendation click-through rates. The findings suggest that user-based (vs. item-based) framing informs customers that the recommendation is based on not just product matching but also taste matching with other customers. Three theoretically derived and practically relevant boundary conditions related to the recommendation recipient, the products, and other users also offer practical guidance for managers regarding how to leverage recommendation framings to increase recommendation click-throughs.

631,"Like Cinderella, many repurposed products involve a biographical transformation, from a tattered past identity (e.g., an old airbag) to a product with a valuable but different new identity (e.g., a backpack made from an airbag). In this article, the authors argue that marketers should help customers infer such product stories by highlighting the products’ tattered past identities. Three field experiments and four controlled experiments show that making a product’s past identity salient boosts demand across a variety of repurposed products. This is because past identity salience induces narrative thoughts about these products’ biographies, which in turn allows customers to feel special. Results also suggest that this strategy of past identity salience needs to be particularly well-crafted for products with easily discernible past identities. These findings highlight a promising new facet of storytelling (i.e., stories that customers self-infer in response to minimal marketer input); create new opportunities for promoting products with a prior life; and deliver detailed guidance for the largely unexplored, growing market for upcycled and recycled products.

632,"Consumers’ postpurchase evaluations have received much attention due to the strong link between ratings and sales. However, less is known about how herding effects from reference groups (i.e., crowd and friends) unfold in online ratings. This research examines the role of divergent opinions, rater experience, and firm product portfolio in attenuating/amplifying herding influences in online rating environments. Applying robust econometric techniques on data from a community of board gamers, we find that herding effects are significant and recommend a more nuanced view of herding. Highlighting the role of rater experience, the positive influence of the crowd is weakened and friend influences are amplified as the rater gains experience. Furthermore, divergent opinions between reference groups create herding and differentiation depending on the reference group and the rater’s experience level. Finally, firms can influence online opinion through their product portfolio in profound ways. A broad and deep product portfolio not only leads to favorable quality inferences but also attenuates social influence. Implications for online reputation management, rating system design, and firm product strategy are discussed.

633,"Words are part of almost every marketplace interaction. Online reviews, customer service calls, press releases, marketing communications, and other interactions create a wealth of textual data. But how can marketers best use such data? This article provides an overview of automated textual analysis and details how it can be used to generate marketing insights. The authors discuss how text reflects qualities of the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and impacts the audience or text recipient. Next, they discuss how text can be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e., insights). Then, the authors overview methodologies and metrics used in text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally, they further highlight some common metrics and challenges and discuss how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity. They conclude with a discussion of potential areas for future work. Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the tribes of marketing. While most marketing problems are interdisciplinary, the field is often fragmented. By involving skills and ideas from each of the subareas of marketing, text analysis has the potential to help unite the field with a common set of tools and approaches.

634,"This article’s objective is to inspire and provide guidance on the development of marketing knowledge based on the theories-in-use (TIU) approach. The authors begin with a description of the TIU approach and compare it with other inductive and deductive research approaches. The benefits of engaging in TIU-based research are discussed, including the development of novel organic marketing theories and the opportunity to cocreate relevant marketing knowledge with practitioners. Next, they review criteria for selecting research questions that are particularly well-suited for examination with TIU-based research. This is followed by detailed suggestions for TIU research: focusing on developing new constructs, theoretical propositions (involving antecedents, moderators, and consequences), and arguments for justifying theoretical propositions. A discussion of TIU tradecraft skills, validity checks, and limitations follows. The authors close with a discussion of future theory-building opportunities using the TIU approach.

635,"Companies often feature positive consumer reviews on their websites and in their promotional materials in an attempt to increase sales. However, little is known about which particular positive reviews companies should leverage to optimize sales. Across four lab studies involving both hypothetical and real choices as well as field data from a retailer’s website (Sephora), the authors find that consumers are more likely to purchase a product if it is recommended by a reviewer who has (vs. has not) made a prior purchase mistake. The authors define a purchase mistake as a self-identified suboptimal decision whereby people purchase a product that subsequently fails to meet a threshold level of expected performance. This persuasive advantage emerges because consumers perceive reviewers who admit a purchase mistake as having more expertise than even reviewers whose purchase experience has not been marred by mistakes. As a result, in marketers’ attempts to increase the persuasive influence of reviews featured in their promotional materials, they may inadvertently decrease it by omitting the very information that would lead consumers to be more likely to purchase recommended products.

636,"Personal relationships between salespeople and customers are essential for the success of business-to-business relationships, and research has shown that a change of the salesperson can severely harm financial performance. However, such interpersonal relationship disruptions may also have positive effects by encouraging vitalizing reexplorations of the relationship. Using multilevel loyalty theory and relationship life cycle theory, the authors offer a comprehensive conceptualization of potentially countervailing consequences of relationship disruptions. In particular, disruptions may have different effects on resale revenue (from previously sold products) versus new sale revenue (from newly sold products), contingent on both the history and expected future development of the relationship. Therefore, this study examines moderators on the firm-level relationship prior to disruption and salesperson relationship management afterward. Longitudinal data from 2,040 customers of an international business-to-business firm reveal that a disruption can increase overall performance by more than 29%, depending on the firm-level relationship before disruption and the new salesperson’s relationship management. Managers can use these findings proactively to evaluate and manage the risks and opportunities involved in relationship disruptions.

637,"While prior research has found that consumer-influenced production improves purchase intentions, the author proposes that it can counterintuitively backfire. This work demonstrates that when consumers have some control over production (e.g., ordering products on demand, customization, preordering), they have lower purchase intentions for products made with unethical processes (e.g., pollution, underpaid labor) than if they had no role in production (i.e., buying what is already in inventory). This effect reverses, however, with positive ethical production (e.g., recycled materials). Because consumers have direct responsibility for whether a product is made, feelings of anticipated guilt or gratification result depending on the ethicality of the production process. This work also proposes a novel threefold conceptualization of responsibility that can be used as managerial levers: direct responsibility, diffusion of responsibility, and broad responsibility. Field studies using Facebook’s advertising platform demonstrate positioning strategies for fair-trade brands and advocacy groups.

638,"Facing competitive and commoditization threats, many companies shift to solution offerings, albeit with mixed results. With a qualitative analysis of dyadic data (suppliers and customers), this article investigates an important, often overlooked reason for such mixed outcomes: the complex, dynamic role of governance matching. This study identifies a series of tensions arising from solution-specific exchange conditions and the matched governance mechanisms actors use to address them: temporary asset colocation, network closure, knowledge-based boundary objects, rights allocation agreements, and liaison champions. It also reveals the dynamic nature of governance matching. Solutions evolve in three phases—experimentation, integration, and evolution—in which single mechanisms have different functions (safeguarding and/or coordination), provide contingent and transient benefits, and can be used in combination to address complex tensions. This study also identifies two decision points, mutual commitment and balanced power, that separate the three phases; their outcomes help explain why certain solution efforts do not take off, others stall, and still others revert to mere spot exchanges. Beyond contributing to solutions literature, these findings provide actionable insights to marketing managers.

639,"To prevail in the fierce competition of in-store experiences, some firms have focused on providing pleasant ambient scents. However, equivocal results on scent effects make generalizations and managerial guidance uncertain. While efforts to consolidate research findings have been conducted, a comprehensive quantitative integration is notably lacking. In this meta-analysis, the authors integrate 671 available effects from ambient scent experiments and show that exposure to pleasant ambient scents on average produces a substantial increase in the level of customer responses (3%–15%). The effects of ambient scent depend on situational contingencies and are, for example, positively related to congruency, unidimensional aroma structure, ascribed familiarity of a scent, service exchange, proportion of female participants in the sample, and imagined (vs. fictitious) offering. Thus, the authors estimate expenditures would increase by 3% and 23% for an average and a most favorable condition, respectively. The authors also examine effect patterns, identifying, for example, ambient scent as more cognitive than affective and nonlinear effects of perceived concentration. Using the insights, they develop a research agenda and provide clear strategic guidance to leverage ambient scent effects.

640,"Consumer research often fails to have broad impact on members of the marketing discipline, on adjacent disciplines studying related phenomena, and on relevant stakeholders who stand to benefit from the knowledge created by rigorous research. The authors propose that impact is limited because consumer researchers have adhered to a set of implicit boundaries or defaults regarding what consumer researchers study, why they study it, and how they do so. The authors identify these boundaries and describe how they can be challenged. By detailing five impactful articles and identifying others, they show that boundary-breaking, marketing-relevant consumer research can influence relevant stakeholders including academics in marketing and allied disciplines as well as a wide range of marketplace actors (e.g., business practitioners, policy makers, the media, society). Drawing on these articles, the authors articulate what researchers can do to break boundaries and enhance the impact of their research. They also indicate why engaging in boundary-breaking work and enhancing the breadth of marketing’s influence is good for both individual researchers and the fields of consumer research and marketing.

641,"Technological advances have resulted in a hyperconnected world, requiring a reassessment of branding research from the perspectives of firms, consumers, and society. Brands are shifting away from single ownership to shared ownership, as heightened access to information and people is allowing more stakeholders to cocreate brand meanings and experiences alongside traditional brand owners and managers. Moreover, hyperconnectivity has allowed existing brands to expand their geographic reach and societal roles, while new types of branded entities (ideas, people, places, and organizational brands) are further stretching the branding space. To help establish a new branding paradigm that accounts for these changes, the authors address the following questions: (1) What are the roles and functions of brands?, (2) How is brand value (co)created?, and (3) How should brands be managed? Throughout the article, the authors also identify future research issues that require scholarly attention, with the aim of aligning branding theory and practice with the realities of a hyperconnected world.

642,"E-negotiations, or sales negotiations over email, are increasingly common in business-to-business (B2B) sales, but little is known about selling effectiveness in this medium. This research investigates salespeople’s use of influence tactics as textual cues to manage buyers’ attention during B2B e-negotiations to win sales contract award. Drawing on studies of attention as a selection heuristic, the authors advance the literature on mechanisms of sales influence by theorizing buyer attention as a key mediating variable between the use of influence tactics and contract award. They use a unique, longitudinal panel spanning more than two years of email communications between buyers and salespeople during B2B sales negotiations to develop a validated corpus of textual cues that are diagnostic of salespeople’s influence tactics in e-negotiations. These e-communications data are augmented by salesperson in-depth interviews and survey, archival performance data, and a controlled experimental study with professional salespeople. The obtained results indicate that the concurrent use of compliance or internalization-based tactics as textual cues bolsters buyers’ attention and is associated with greater likelihood of contract award. In contrast, concurrent use of compliance and internalization-based tactics is prone to degrade buyer attention and likely to put the salesperson at a disadvantage in closing the contract award.

643,"Online virality has attracted the attention of academics and marketers who want to identify the characteristics of online content that promote sharing. This article adds to this body of research by examining the phenomenon of improvised marketing interventions (IMIs)—social media actions that are composed and executed in real time proximal to an external event. Using the concept of quick wit, and theorizing that the effect of IMIs is furthered by humor and timeliness or unanticipation, the authors find evidence of these effects on both virality and firm value across five multimethod studies, including quasiexperiments, experiments, and archival data analysis. These findings point to the potential of IMIs in social media and to the features that firms should proactively focus on managing in order to reap the observed online sharing and firm value benefits.

644,"In response to pressure to defend their stand sales against discounters, grocery retailers started engaging in retailer-themed super saver events: promotional events (1) specific to the retailer, in which they (2) mass advertise (3) unusually deep, immediate deals (4) across a broad range of categories (5) under a common savings theme and deal format. Given these characteristics, such events are expected to generate higher awareness and interest than typical day-to-day promotions, thereby enhancing visits and purchases during the event but also reducing them before and after. The authors evaluate these effects by analyzing 44 retailer-themed super saver events operated by the largest Dutch grocery retailers over four years. They find a substantial increase in visits and total purchases during the event, especially among nonprimary customers and hard-discount shoppers. The larger part of this lift stems from the use of an overarching event theme. Consumers buy less in anticipation of the event and visit the store more often afterward, but for smaller baskets—typically leading to a null effect in terms of profit. Finally, our results suggest that rather than the deal depth or advertising budget, the number of items and media resonance of the theme are key drivers of event success.

645,"The authors study differences in the effects of prices, nonprice promotions, and brand line length on brand shares at different retail formats. Their conceptual framework rests on the presence of trip-level fixed and category-level variable utility components and shows how the trade-off between these components results in (1) different formats visited on different types of shopping trips and (2) differential marginal sensitivities of brand shares to changes in marketing-mix variables across trip types. Together, these provide predictions on how marketing-mix variables differentially affect brand shares at various retail formats. The authors use Nielsen Homescan and store-level data from 2011–2014 and analyze the top ten spending product categories across four retail formats—convenience stores, drugstores, supermarkets, and mass merchandisers—in over 200 Nielsen markets. Implications for brand manufacturers managing the marketing mix across different formats are offered. JEL codes: M310, L11, D4
","We examine the impact of product categories on the price of a product category in a retail setting. We use a panel data set of product categories from the U.S. grocery chain, Target, to examine the impact of product categories on the price of a product category in a retail setting. We find that product categories increase the price of a product category by $1.25 for a category with a higher price than a category with a lower price. We also find that product categories increase the price of a category with a lower price than a category with a higher price. We also find that product categories increase the price of a category with a higher price than a category with a lower price. We discuss the implications of these findings for retail pricing and consumer choice.  For example, we find that product categories increase the price of a category with a higher price than a category with a lower price.

646,"In their initial recovery efforts after a service failure, service providers need to decide what to communicate to consumers to restore their satisfaction. Prior work has primarily examined apology (saying “sorry”) as a symbolic recovery strategy; the current research suggests appreciation (saying “thank you”) as an alternative, often more effective strategy. Drawing from research on linguistic framing and self-view, the authors reason that the shift of focus in the service provider–consumer interaction, from emphasizing service providers’ fault and accountability (apology) to spotlighting consumers’ merits and contributions (appreciation), can increase consumers’ self-esteem and, in turn, postrecovery satisfaction. Across multiple service failure contexts, Studies 1a–1e establish the superiority of appreciation in redressing service failures. By measuring and manipulating self-esteem and examining the moderating role of narcissism and recovery timing, Studies 2–5 provide converging evidence for consumers’ state self-esteem as the underlying mechanism. Studies 6 and 7 go beyond examining appreciation in isolation and show that it is as effective as recovery messages that combine appreciation and apology (Study 6) and that its superiority over apology holds when service providers combine symbolic and utilitarian recovery (Study 7).
","We examine how the “social responsibility” (SRI) framework—the notion that individuals can benefit from their own efforts to improve their own performance—can help firms to improve their performance. We argue that SRI can help firms to improve their performance by providing a means of “social responsibility” (i.e., “social responsibility” that is not tied to the performance of the firm) and by providing a means of “social responsibility” that is not tied to the performance of the firm. We find that the “social responsibility” framework is more effective when firms are more likely to engage in “social responsibility” (i.e., “social responsibility” that is not tied to the performance of the firm) than when firms are less likely to engage in “social responsibility” (i.e., “social responsibility” that is not tied to the performance of the firm). We also find that the “social responsibility” framework is more effective when firms are more likely to engage in “social responsibility” (i.e., “social responsibility” that is not tied to the performance of the firm) than when firms are",0.4965551,-0.9476265,-1.2748722,-0.7631511,-0.24561673,-1.5621378,-0.6742378,1.9934608,0.6151064,-0.24325797,-0.92571956,0.591278,-0.46504125,-0.43406788,-0.8105692,1.3170859,0.5091228,-0.72993743,0.76114243,0.57311195,-0.5121168,-0.86460805,-0.56800187,0.045140676,-0.08463377,0.46995443,0.20033494,0.06744737,0.30041945,-0.15107468,0.5759518,0.77714694,-0.78429115,-2.2704322,-0.63028264,-0.66952103,-0.658168,-0.78349507,-1.7614844,-0.46915787,0.6427851,0.48147145,-0.24171971,-0.2439781,-0.16330129,1.250942,-0.14671917,0.4602927,0.7495809,-0.44849893,0.50284255,-0.6626153,0.28156927,-0.54376304,-0.73396534,-0.27696759,0.7024906,0.8350283,0.21858793,-0.34695718,-1.0537293,0.85427904,-1.1393476,1.2025876,0.65879816,0.49412906,0.75045806,-0.052790117,0.17245848,0.763411,-0.79709226,0.7455256,2.0533037,-0.9506403,0.19311626,0.9362226,0.6167068,1.0337427,0.900844,-0.5705009,0.8016805,-1.5871333,0.5943857,-0.6907473,-1.1687299,2.9278905,-0.34150702,-0.20491163,-0.24410625,0.6174089,-0.064050384,-0.107569456,0.60207033,-1.0926638,0.28524464,-0.7619619,1.1300828,-1.0123651,0.70499694,-0.065007076,0.76758045,-0.8810959,-0.38819787,0.9812876,0.26459715,0.34932464,0.87729603,0.005838235,-0.30990732,0.8111749,0.529584,0.21408446,1.0222507,0.08096435,-0.067479625,1.4060005,-0.99552375,0.9792491,-0.2748335,1.4218391,-1.3627969,-0.09526585,0.2938623,-1.6423051,-1.7187312,-0.30114183,-0.41034627,-1.1411409
647,"Patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer should undergo semiannual screening tests to facilitate early detection, effective treatment options at lower cost, better recovery prognosis, and higher life expectancy. Health care institutions invest in direct-to-patient outreach marketing to encourage regular screening. They ask the following questions: (1) Does the effectiveness of outreach vary among patients and over time?; (2) What is the return on outreach?; and (3) Can patient-level targeted outreach increase the return? The authors use a multiperiod, randomized field experiment involving 1,800 patients. Overall, relative to the usual-care condition, outreach alone (outreach with patient navigation) increases screening completion rates by 10–20 (13–24) percentage points. Causal forests demonstrate that patient-level treatment effects vary substantially across periods and by patients’ demographics, health status, visit history, health system accessibility, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, thereby facilitating the implementation of the targeted outreach program. A simulation shows that the targeted outreach program improves the return on the randomized outreach program by 74%–96% or $1.6 million to $2 million. Thus, outreach marketing provides a substantial positive payoff to the health care system.
","We study the impact of a patient-centered, patient-centered, and patient-centered care on patient outcomes. We develop a model to estimate the impact of patient-centered care on patient outcomes. We use a randomized field experiment to test our model using a large-scale, randomized clinical trial. We find that patient-centered care significantly reduces patient-centered outcomes, but it does not significantly reduce patient-centered outcomes. Patient-centered care reduces patient-centered outcomes by reducing the number of patients who are eligible for care, but it does not significantly reduce patient-centered outcomes by reducing the number of patients who are eligible for care.

648,"Results from three large-scale field studies and two controlled experiments show that consumers tend to be more self-disclosing when generating content on their smartphone versus personal computer. This tendency is found in a wide range of domains including social media posts, online restaurant reviews, open-ended survey responses, and compliance with requests for personal information in web advertisements. The authors show that this increased willingness to self-disclose on one’s smartphone arises from the psychological effects of two distinguishing properties of the device: (1) feelings of comfort that many associate with their smartphone and (2) a tendency to narrowly focus attention on the disclosure task at hand due to the relative difficulty of generating content on the smaller device. The enhancing effect of smartphones on self-disclosure yields several important marketing implications, including the creation of content that is perceived as more persuasive by outside readers. The authors explore implications for how these findings can be strategically leveraged by managers, including how they may generalize to other emerging technologies.
",We examine the effects of social media on consumers’ purchase decisions. We find that social media use increases the likelihood of purchase decisions by consumers who are more likely to purchase from a retailer. We also find that social media use increases the likelihood of purchase decisions by consumers who are more likely to purchase from a retailer. We also find that social media use increases the likelihood of purchase decisions by consumers who are more likely to purchase from a retailer. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of consumer-level social media platforms and the design of consumer-level social media platforms for online retailing. We find that social media use increases the likelihood of purchase decisions by consumers who are more likely to purchase from a retailer. We also find that social media use increases the likelihood of purchase decisions by consumers who are more likely to purchase from a retailer. Our findings contribute to the literature on social media use and consumer-level social media platforms by providing insights into the mechanisms through which social media use and consumer-level social media platforms can influence purchase decisions.  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \,0.8166692,-0.079074405,-1.064437,-1.5755264,-0.16097587,-0.4653836,0.21306221,1.2911282,0.7733372,0.31543162,0.37959576,-0.26989877,-0.57129097,-0.46153036,-0.47962087,0.50012916,-0.046882916,-0.6929754,-0.22233622,-0.57824093,-1.2793442,-0.7142991,0.01726716,0.41725633,-1.2357701,-0.26584148,0.29118234,-0.65977365,0.50656205,-0.6701636,0.49546668,-0.10201585,-1.7747846,-1.6756128,-0.5266279,0.4994739,0.32289472,-0.94167,-0.4619496,-0.62470114,0.118659616,-0.25842425,-0.21414375,-0.023175608,0.013745541,0.03154716,-0.9824785,0.5112377,0.64399403,-0.6009355,-0.6231328,0.8853766,-0.58339804,0.35299215,-0.11842473,0.16377729,-0.042166594,0.17596439,0.35223016,-1.0002238,-1.5948466,1.1308744,0.6495244,0.02468892,-0.2694322,-0.09395546,0.12932767,-0.7913324,0.7678047,0.64625055,-0.27625006,1.5194118,1.3911806,-1.4085318,-0.32015458,0.61607164,0.5238168,-0.058282632,-0.0131446505,0.29064417,1.5688372,-0.43145093,0.017892495,1.3075213,-0.34435913,0.89098096,-1.0888511,-1.0775257,-0.19103143,0.27004465,0.4561518,0.33737198,-0.62678266,-0.07306242,0.5680927,-0.13917695,-0.67780215,0.09486387,0.2673058,0.8418115,0.58846575,-0.19776142,-0.1354852,1.2710803,0.044091355,0.29724687,0.4995232,-0.35240075,0.47679883,-0.62263584,0.79614615,0.06811651,0.6636316,-0.015513861,0.4524953,0.56058216,0.25170565,0.2580602,0.76173604,0.72762346,0.39173996,-0.38682774,-0.6822871,0.6891343,-1.273735,0.09150502,-0.44359374,-0.26768938
649,"Companies are increasingly held accountable for their corporate social irresponsibility (CSI). However, the extent to which a CSI event damages the firm largely depends on the coverage of this event in high-reach news media. Using the theory of news value developed in communications research, the authors explain the amount of media coverage by introducing a set of variables related to the event, the involved brand, and media outlet. The authors analyze a sample of 1,054 CSI events that were reported in 77 leading media outlets in five countries in the period 2008–2014. Estimation results reveal many drivers. For example, the number of media covering the story may be 39% higher for salient and strong brands. 80% more media report the event if a foreign brand is involved in a domestic CSI event. When a brand advertises heavily or exclusively in a news medium, this reduces the likelihood of the news medium to cover negative stories about the brand. The average financial loss at the U.S. stock market due to a CSI event amounts to US$321 million. However, the market reacts to the event only if 4 or more U.S. high-reach media outlets report on the event.

650,"Nonprofit organizations often rely on individuals to execute their mission of addressing unmet societal needs. Indeed, one of the most significant challenges facing such organizations is that of enlisting individuals to provide support through the volunteering of time or donation of money. To address this challenge, prior studies have examined how promotional messages can be leveraged to motivate individuals to support the missions of nonprofit organizations. Yet promotional messages are only one aspect of the marketing mix that may be employed. The present study examines how donor-based nonprofit organizations can employ the marketing mix—product, price, promotion, place, process, and people—to influence the experiences of sacrifice associated with donation. The authors do so through an ethnographic study of individuals participating in living organ donation. First, they identify the manifestation of sacrifice in donation. Next, they define three complementary and interactive types of sacrifice: psychic, pecuniary, and physical. Then, they articulate how the marketing mix can be employed to mitigate experiences of sacrifice that emerge through the donation process. The authors conclude by discussing implications for marketing practice and identifying additional research opportunities for sacrifice in the realm of donation.

651,"Cultural products are a major component of the world economy and are responsible for a growing share of U.S. exports. The authors examine brand name strategies when cultural products are marketed in foreign countries. Incorporating the unique characteristics of these products, the authors develop a theoretical framework that integrates similarity, which focuses on how the translated brand name relates to the original brand name, and informativeness, which focuses on how the translated brand name reveals product content, to study the impact of brand name translations. The authors analyze Hollywood movies shown in China from 2011 to 2018. The results show that higher similarity leads to higher Chinese box office revenue, and this effect is stronger for movies that perform better in the home market (i.e., the United States). When the translated title is more informative about the movie, the Chinese box office revenue increases. The informativeness effect is stronger for Hollywood movies with greater cultural gap in the Chinese market. Moreover, both similarity and informativeness effects are strongest when the movie is released and reduce over time. This research provides valuable guidance to companies, managers, and policy makers in cultural product industries as well as those in international marketing.

652,"Firms often attribute their service employees’ competent performance to either dedicated effort or natural talent. However, it is unclear how such practices affect customer evaluations of service employees and customer outcomes. Moreover, prior work has primarily examined attributions of one’s own performance, providing little insight on the impact of attributions of others’ performance. Drawing on research regarding the warmth–competence framework and performance attributions, the current research proposes and finds that consumers expect a more communal-oriented and less exchange-oriented relationship when a service employee’s competent performance is attributed to dedicated effort rather than natural talent, as effort (vs. talent) attribution leads consumers to perceive the employee as warmer. The authors further propose customer helping behaviors as downstream consequences of relationship expectations, finding that effort (vs. talent) attribution is more likely to induce customers’ word-of-mouth and idea provision behaviors. The findings enrich existing literature by identifying performance attributions as a managerially meaningful antecedent of relationship expectations and offer practical guidance on how marketers can influence consumers’ relationship expectations and helping behaviors.

653,"This article examines the effects of collective layoff announcements on sales and marketing-mix elasticities, accounting for supply-side constraints. The authors study 205 announcements in the automotive industry using a difference-in-differences model. They find that, following collective layoff announcements, layoff firms experience adverse changes in sales, advertising elasticity, and price elasticity. They explore the moderating role of announcement characteristics on these changes and find that collective layoff announcements by domestic firms and announcements that do not mention a decline in demand as a motive are more likely to be followed by adverse marketing-mix elasticity changes. On average, sales for the layoff firm in the layoff country are 8.7% lower following a collective layoff announcement than their predicted levels absent the announcement. Similarly, advertising elasticity is 9.8% lower and price elasticity is 19.2% higher than absent the announcement. Conversely, layoff firms typically decrease advertising spending in the country where collective layoffs have occurred, yet they do not change prices. These findings are relevant to marketing managers of firms undergoing collective layoffs and to analysts of collective layoff decisions.

654,"Marketing excellence is a foundational principle for the discipline that is gaining increasing attention among managers and investors. Despite this, the nature of marketing excellence and its effectiveness remain unclear. This research offers insight by addressing two questions: (1) How do managers understand and exercise marketing excellence? and (2) How do investors evaluate marketing excellence? Study 1 merges insights from 39 in-depth interviews with senior executives and secondary data from 150 firm strategies to find that marketing excellence is a strategy type focused on achieving organic growth by executing priorities related to the marketing ecosystem, end user, and marketing agility. Study 2 quantifies the impact of marketing excellence on firm value by using a machine learning algorithm and text analysis through an original dictionary to classify the text from 8,317 letters to shareholders in 1,727 U.S. firm annual reports. Calendar-time portfolio models reveal abnormal one-year returns of up to 8.58% for marketing excellence—returns that outpace those associated with market orientation and marketing capabilities. Findings offer guidance to managers, educators, and investors regarding how marketing excellence manifests—paving the way for the allocation of firm resources to ensure that marketing drives organic growth.

655,"Although scholars have established that customer satisfaction affects different dimensions of firm financial performance, a managerially important but overlooked aspect is its effect on a firm’s future cost of selling (COS), that is, expenditures associated with persuading customers and providing convenience to them. Accordingly, this study presents the first empirical and theoretical examination of the impact of customer satisfaction on future COS. The authors propose that while higher customer satisfaction can lower future COS, the degree to which a firm realizes this benefit depends on its strategy and operating environment. Analyzing almost two decades of data from 128 firms, the authors find that customer satisfaction has a statistically and economically significant negative effect on future COS. While the negative effect of customer satisfaction on future COS is weaker for firms with higher capital intensity and financial leverage, this effect is stronger for more diversified firms and for firms operating in industries with higher growth and labor intensity. The authors also find that these effects may vary across two components of COS, cost of persuasion and convenience.

656,"Customer experience management research is increasingly concerned with the long-term evolution of customer experience journeys across multiple service cycles. A dominant smooth journey model makes customers’ lives easier, with a cyclical pattern of predictable experiences that builds customer loyalty over time, also known as a loyalty loop. An alternate sticky journey model makes customers’ lives exciting, with a cyclical pattern of unpredictable experiences that increases customer involvement over time, conceptualized here as an involvement spiral. Whereas the smooth journey model is ideal for instrumental services that facilitate jobs to be done, the sticky journey model is ideal for recreational services that facilitate never-ending adventures. To match the flow of each journey type, firms are advised to encourage purchases during the initial service cycles of smooth journeys, or subsequent service cycles of sticky journeys. In multiservice systems, firms can sustain customer journeys by interlinking loyalty loops and involvement spirals. The article concludes with new journey-centered questions for customer experience management research, as well as branding research, consumer culture theory, consumer psychology, and transformative service research.

657,"Given the positive bias toward attractive people in society, online sellers are justifiably apprehensive about perceptions of their profile pictures. Although the existing literature emphasizes the “beauty premium” and the “ugliness penalty,” the current studies of seller profile pictures on customer-to-customer e-commerce platforms find a U-shaped relationship between facial attractiveness and product sales (i.e., both beauty and ugliness premiums and, thus, a “plainness penalty”). By analyzing two large data sets, the authors find that both attractive and unattractive people sell significantly more than plain-looking people. Two online experiments reveal that attractive sellers enjoy greater source credibility due to perceived sociability and competence, whereas unattractive sellers are considered more believable on the basis of their perceived competence. While a beauty premium is apparent for appearance-relevant products, an ugliness premium is more pronounced for expertise-relevant products and for female consumers evaluating male sellers. These findings highlight the influence of facial appearance as a key vehicle for impression formation in online platforms and its complex effects in e-commerce and marketing.

658,"This research documents how negative reviews, when perceived as unfair, can activate feelings of empathy toward firms that have been wronged. Six studies and four supplemental experiments provide converging evidence that this experienced empathy for the firm motivates supportive consumer responses such as paying higher purchase prices and reporting increased patronage intentions. Importantly, this research highlights factors that can increase or decrease empathy toward a firm. For instance, adopting the reviewer’s perspective when evaluating an unfair negative review can reduce positive consumer responses to a firm, whereas conditions that enhance the ability to experience empathy—such as when reviews are highly unfair, when the identity of the employee is made salient, or when the firm responds in an empathetic manner—can result in positive consumer responses toward the firm. Overall, this work extends the understanding of consumers’ responses to word of mouth in the marketplace by highlighting the role of perceived (un)fairness. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings for better management of consumer reviews.

659,"When advertising products to consumers, firms sometimes conceal key aspects in an effort to arouse consumer curiosity. This research investigates when and how visual concealment tactics may benefit or hurt aesthetic product evaluations. The authors propose that when consumers are only able to view a portion of an aesthetic product, assessments of its appeal will be influenced by two interrelated mechanisms: curiosity to see the item completed and inferences about the item’s fully disclosed appearance. The authors show that heightened curiosity triggers feelings of positive affect that are transferred to the product itself, a process that may inflate preferences and choice likelihoods for products beyond what would occur if the full image were known. This transference effect, however, has an important boundary: it works only when initial consumer inferences about the appeal of the product are positive or emotionally congruent with the positive affect triggered by curiosity. The key implication is that, ironically, the products likely to benefit most from concealment tactics are those that have the least to hide. The authors provide evidence for these effects and the underlying mechanism using six experiments that manipulate concealment in a variety of task settings.

660,"The authors examine consumers’ information channel usage during the customer journey by employing a hedonic and utilitarian (H/U) perspective, an important categorization of consumption purpose. Taking a retailer-category viewpoint to measure the H/U characteristics of 20 product categories at 40 different retailers, this study combines large-scale secondary clickstream and primary survey data to offer actionable insights for retailers in a competitive landscape. The data reveal that, when making hedonic purchases (e.g., toys), consumers employ social media and on-site product pages as early as two weeks before the final purchase. By contrast, for utilitarian purchases (e.g., office supplies), consumers utilize third-party reviews up to two weeks before the final purchase and make relatively greater usage of search engines, deals, and competitors’ product pages closer to the time of purchase. Importantly, channel usage is different for sessions in which no purchase is made, indicating that consumers’ information channel choices vary significantly with the H/U characteristics of purchases. The article closes with an extensive discussion of the significant implications for managing customer touchpoints.

661,"This work introduces the concept of contract ambiguity from the law literature into the interorganizational governance literature. Within the context of franchising, the authors present a three-study multimethod design empirically establishing the construct of contract ambiguity of franchisor obligations, providing new insights into the strategic design of contracts and their outcomes. In Study 1, the authors establish construct validity by demonstrating that contract ambiguity of franchisor obligations is distinct from contract specificity and contract completeness of franchisor obligations, with differential outcomes. In Studies 2 and 3, the authors demonstrate that contract ambiguity of franchisor obligations increases an interest-based (vs. a rights-based) conflict solving approach, implying greater cooperation and joint problem solving, and reduces franchisee-initiated litigation. The findings also indicate that while contract ambiguity of franchisor obligations decreases franchisee-initiated litigation, this effect is amplified by higher levels of franchisor training programs but mitigated by the presence of a franchisee association. The article closes with a discussion of implications for academics and practitioners.

662,"Stakeholders have long pressured firms to provide societal benefits in addition to generating shareholder wealth. Such benefits have traditionally come in the form of corporate social responsibility. However, many stakeholders now expect firms to demonstrate their values by expressing public support for or opposition to one side of a partisan sociopolitical issue, a phenomenon the authors call “corporate sociopolitical activism” (CSA). Such activities differ from commonly favored corporate social responsibility and have the potential to both strengthen and sever stakeholder relationships, thus making their impact on firm value uncertain. Using signaling and screening theories, the authors analyze 293 CSA events initiated by 149 firms across 39 industries, and find that, on average, CSA elicits an adverse reaction from investors. Investors evaluate CSA as a signal of a firm’s allocation of resources away from profit-oriented objectives and toward a risky activity with uncertain outcomes. The authors further identify two sets of moderators: (1) CSA’s deviation from key stakeholders’ values and brand image and (2) characteristics of CSA’s resource implementation, which affect investor and customer responses. The findings provide new and important implications for marketing theory and practice.
","We examine the impact of social capital on the value of a firm’s reputation and the impact of social capital on the firm’s reputation and the firm’s reputation-building behavior. We find that social capital increases the likelihood of a firm’s reputation-building behavior, and the firm’s reputation-building behavior increases the likelihood of a firm’s reputation-building behavior. We also find that social capital increases the likelihood of a firm’s reputation-building behavior, and the firm’s reputation-building behavior increases the likelihood of a firm’s reputation-building behavior. We also find that social capital increases the likelihood of a firm’s reputation-building behavior, and the firm’s reputation-building behavior increases the likelihood of a firm’s reputation-building behavior. We also find that social capital increases the likelihood of a firm’s reputation-building behavior, and the firm’s reputation-building behavior increases the likelihood of a firm’s reputation-building behavior. We discuss implications for the management of reputation-building behavior and the management of reputation-building behavior in the context of the global financial crisis.  \  \  \",-0.04502873,-0.5255758,-1.2649301,-0.64372003,0.09073418,-0.23571983,-0.928059,0.72029305,0.26784962,0.49284568,0.2589246,1.1933086,0.6840679,-0.48796433,0.22888558,0.714236,-0.8873312,-0.95833004,-0.14710341,0.24321376,0.9410296,0.1014913,-0.4342195,0.41296205,-1.179432,0.36972845,0.43634105,0.05938713,0.46609923,0.0095590465,0.83285236,1.3891315,-0.56531656,-2.826721,-0.4310515,0.6226599,0.07826245,0.72861797,-1.0042533,-0.27537417,-0.41637173,0.26170972,-0.13859628,0.08054545,-0.20700261,0.13961594,0.0656959,-1.0192666,0.10235197,0.8378089,1.283339,-0.72951484,-0.0975134,1.9589467,-0.04426237,1.0876467,0.181673,-0.09682134,0.5236192,-0.38266802,-1.1886692,1.3291384,-0.11896598,0.31920025,0.62891597,-0.3401471,0.42294702,0.39466736,-0.061233316,-0.2682816,-1.6025126,0.110771365,1.3780817,-1.2294419,-0.78409445,0.58578295,-0.5820395,0.5471716,0.3046602,-0.63952506,0.49540412,-1.2172302,0.5957392,0.421112,-0.22718103,2.4431515,0.3753153,0.29198927,-0.9666314,-1.0977919,0.4277021,-0.04710183,-0.61603546,-0.7808171,0.6480179,-0.13717094,-0.4071781,0.10072688,0.4385878,1.4096166,0.6054108,-0.3041826,1.1376929,-0.13960691,-0.45922774,1.0066067,-0.40464607,0.49426383,-0.050199077,-0.79634035,0.83552265,1.4829818,1.1504743,0.8683151,1.2290468,0.3749128,-1.6186181,0.62308216,0.0683114,1.4263432,-0.4874417,0.6898593,-0.6640606,0.23194142,-1.097446,-0.122845165,-0.37718698,-0.60498714
663,"Advertising and research and development (R&D) benefit firms by increasing sales and shareholder value. However, when a firm is in bankruptcy, the cumulative effects of its past advertising and R&D can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they increase the firm’s expected future cash flow, which increases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide the firm can survive. On the other hand, they increase the liquidation value of the firm’s assets, which decreases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide that the firm can survive. The author argues that the ability of advertising and R&D to either increase or decrease bankruptcy survival is contingent on the influence that the firm’s suppliers have, relative to other creditors, on the bankruptcy court’s decision. Advertising and R&D increase (decrease) bankruptcy survival when suppliers have a high (low) level of influence. Empirical analyses, conducted on 1,504 bankruptcies, show that advertising (R&D) increases bankruptcy survival when at least 35%−38% (18%−21%) of the bankrupt firm’s debt has been borrowed from suppliers, whereas it decreases bankruptcy survival below this point. Out-of-sample machine learning validation shows that the ability to predict whether a bankrupt customer will survive is substantially improved by considering the firm’s advertising and R&D.

664,"Firms often aim to develop markets as part of their long-term strategies. Conventionally, research in marketing has explained this complex process by stressing firms’ efforts to outdo their peers. While this emphasis is valuable, it overlooks the role of another major force in market evolution: collective action among peer firms. To address this oversight, this article conceptualizes “collaborative market driving,” defining it as the collective strategy in which peer firms consistently cooperate among themselves and with other actors to develop markets in ways that increase their overall competitiveness. This conceptualization includes the triggers that lead peer firms to mobilize for collective action and coalesce with other market actors; it also identifies how this coalition converts collective resources into market-driving power. These theoretical contributions, based on a multimethod analysis of the rise of U.S. craft breweries, offer an alternative course of action for firms interested in driving new markets when they lack adequate resources to do so individually.

665,"New products can evoke anticipatory emotions such as hope and anxiety. On the one hand, consumers might hope that innovative offerings will produce goal-congruent outcomes; on the other hand, they might also be anxious about possible outcomes that are goal-incongruent. The authors demonstrate the provocative and counterintuitive finding that strong anxiety about potentially goal-incongruent outcomes from a new product actually enhances (vs. weakens) consequential adoption intentions (Study 1) and actual adoption (Studies 2 and 3) when hope is also strong. The authors test action planning (a form of elaboration) and perceived control over outcomes as serial mediators to explain this effect. They find that the proposed mechanism holds even after they consider alternative explanations, including pain/gain inferences, confidence in achieving goal-congruent outcomes, global elaboration, affective forecasts, and motivated reasoning. Managerially, the findings suggest that when bringing a new product to market, new product adoption may be greatest when hope and anxiety are both strong. The findings also point to ways in which marketers might enhance hope and/or anxiety, and they suggest that the use of potentially anxiety-inducing tactics such as disclaimers in ads and on packages might not deter adoption when hope is also strong.

666,"Firms spend substantial resources responding to customer complaints, and the marketing profession has a long history of supporting that enterprise to promote customer loyalty. The authors question whether this response is always warranted or whether its effectiveness instead depends on economic, industry, customer–firm, product/service, and customer segment factors that may alter the firm’s incentives to compete on complaint management. To consider this question, they integrate economic and marketing theories and investigate factors that influence the complaint recovery–customer loyalty relationship via a sample of 35,597 complaining customers spanning a ten-year period across economic sectors, industries, and firms. Overall, the authors find that the recovery–loyalty relationship is stronger in faster-growing economies, for industries with more competition, for luxury products, and for customers with higher satisfaction and higher expectations of customization. Conversely, the recovery–loyalty relationship is weaker when customers’ expectations of product/service reliability are higher, for manufactured goods, and for men compared with women. The authors discuss implications of these results for managers, policy makers, and researchers for more effective management of customer complaints.

667,"Digital ads often display video content in which immobile products are presented as if they are moving spontaneously. Six studies demonstrate a speed-based scaling effect, such that consumers estimate the size of an immobile product to be smaller when it is animated to move faster in videos, due to the inverse size–speed association they have learned from the domain of animate agents (e.g., animals, humans). Supporting a cross-domain knowledge transfer model of learned size–speed association, this speed-based scaling effect is (1) reduced when consumers perceive a product’s movement pattern as less similar to animate agents’ movement patterns, (2) reversed when a positive size–speed association in the base domain of animate agents is made accessible, (3) attenuated for consumers who have more knowledge about the target product domain, and (4) mitigated when explicit product size information is highlighted. Furthermore, by decreasing assessed product size, fast animated movement speed can either positively or negatively influence willingness to pay, depending on consumers’ size preferences.

668,"Although reacquiring customers can lead to beneficial outcomes, reacquisition processes are often unpleasant for employees, who may be required to admit and address failures. Because many organizational environments reward success and punish failure, companies need to understand how to create an organizational environment that stimulates customer reacquisitions. This study investigates the impact of failure-tolerant cultures and formal reacquisition policies on successful customer reacquisition management. Drawing on organizational design theory and psychological ownership theory, the authors find that failure-tolerant cultures have an inverted U-shaped effect on reacquisition performance because moderate failure tolerance increases reacquisition attempts while not inducing more failures or increasing their severity. Formal reacquisition policies, in contrast, have a positive linear relationship. Notably, formal reacquisition policies do not conflict with failure-tolerant cultures but enhance the beneficial effects of failure tolerance on reacquisition performance; formal reacquisition policies provide guidance for reacquisition attempts that failure-tolerant cultures inspire. Finally, results show that customer reacquisition performance is positively related to overall firm financial performance, a finding that emphasizes the managerial and organizational-level importance of reacquisition management.

669,"Marketing communications often describe a reduction in a product’s negative attributes (e.g., “our mineral water now uses 34% less plastic”). This claim may be interpreted as a trend of improving relative to previous state. However, such a claim may also call attention to a negative product feature that might have otherwise been overlooked. The authors suggest that whether consumers are positively or negatively influenced by such claims depends on whether the claims are interpreted through an incremental or entity mindset. When a reduction in negative attributes is viewed through an incremental mindset—the tendency to think of attributes as malleable—a trend-based interpretation results in improved product evaluations. In contrast, an entity mindset that emphasizes attributes are unlikely to change produces a negative effect for the claim. Four experiments and a field survey (N = 2,543) across food, pharmaceuticals, and plastic bottle products confirm the effects and indicate that the effects diminish when consumers believe the attribute is easy to eliminate or when the attribute has extremely threatening consequences. The opposite is observed for claims of reduced positive attributes, such that an entity mindset produces more positive evaluations. The findings offer marketers consumer insights to guide the communication of negatively framed attributes.

670,"“Facts Up Front” nutrition labels are a front-of-package (FOP) nutrition labeling system that presents key nutrient information on the front of packaged food and beverage products in an easy-to-read format. The authors conduct a large-scale empirical study to examine the effect of adoption of FOP labeling on products’ nutritional quality. The authors assemble a unique data set on packaged food products in the United States across 44 categories over 16 years. By using a difference-in-differences estimator, the authors find that FOP adoption in a product category leads to an improvement in the nutritional quality of other products in that category. This competitive response is stronger for premium brands and brands with narrower product line breadth as well as for categories involving unhealthy products and those that are more competitive in nature. The authors offer evidence regarding the role of nutrition information salience as the underlying mechanism; they also perform supplementary analyses to rule out potential self-selection issues and conduct a battery of robustness checks and falsification tests. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for public policy makers, consumers, manufacturers, and food retailers.

671,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) business models have become increasingly prevalent in the marketplace. However, little is known about what factors influence consumer perceptions of purchases from firms using these models. The authors propose that features inherent to the P2P model lead consumers to perceive high provider–firm independence, where providers are viewed as relatively independent from the platform on which they offer goods/services. Across a series of studies, the authors show that when P2P brands use provider-focused (vs. platform-focused) marketing communications, consumers perceive a purchase as helping an individual provider to a greater extent, which increases consumers’ willingness to pay and their likelihood of both making a purchase and downloading the brand’s app. This is because provider-focused marketing communications in this context lead consumers to think about their purchase from the provider’s perspective, thus adopting an “empathy lens.” The authors further show that this effect does not extend to other business models. This work thus identifies provider- (vs. platform-) focused marketing communications as a way for marketing managers of P2P brands to drive important purchase-related outcomes.

672,"Although creativity is often considered a key success factor in advertising, the marketing literature lacks a systematic empirical account of when and how advertising creativity works. The authors use a meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on advertising creativity and test different theoretical explanations for its effects. The analysis covers 93 data sets taken from 67 papers that provide 878 effect sizes. The results show robust positive effects but also highlight the importance of considering both originality and appropriateness when investing in advertising creativity. Moderation analyses show that the effects of advertising creativity are stronger for high- (vs. low-) involvement products, and that the effects on ad (but not brand) reactions are marginally stronger for unfamiliar brands. An empirical test of theoretical mechanisms shows that affect transfer, processing, and signaling jointly explain these effects, and that originality mainly leads to affect transfer, whereas appropriateness leads to signaling. The authors also call for further research connecting advertising creativity with sales and studying its effects in digital contexts.

673,"Charities often include low-value monetary (e.g., coins) and nonmonetary (e.g., greeting cards) pregiving incentives (PGIs) in their donation request letters. Yet little is known about how donors respond to this marketing strategy. In seven studies, including two large-scale field experiments, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of PGIs depends on the organization’s goals. People are more likely to open and read a letter containing a monetary PGI (vs. a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI). In addition, monetary PGIs increase response rates in donor acquisition campaigns. However, the return on investment for direct mail campaigns drops significantly when PGIs are included. Furthermore, average donations for appeals with a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI are similar, while those with a monetary PGI are actually lower than when a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI is included. This is because monetary PGIs increase exchange norms while decreasing communal norms. This effect remains significant when accounting for alternative explanations such as manipulative intent and the anchoring and adjustment heuristic.
","We study the effect of a tax on the value of a company’s stock. We find that the tax increases the value of the company’s stock by a factor of 1.5. This effect is stronger for companies with higher tax rates. However, the effect of the tax on the value of the company’s stock is weaker for firms with lower tax rates. We also find that the tax increases the value of the company’s stock by a factor of 1.5. This effect is stronger for firms with higher tax rates. However, the effect of the tax on the value of the company’s stock is weaker for firms with lower tax rates. We also find that the tax increases the value of the company’s stock by a factor of 1.5.

674,"Persistent high failure rates of new product alliances call for identification of factors that might improve alliance outcomes. In this research, the authors identify two attributes of alliance network asymmetry that affect alliance performance and performance uncertainty: differences in the number of prealliance direct ties, which can create asymmetry in the volume of resources of the two firms, and differences in the interconnectivity among prealliance indirect ties, which leads the firms to possess different types of resources. The authors theorize that absolute levels of such asymmetries have curvilinear effects on alliance performance and performance uncertainty, which materialize as a focal firm’s abnormal returns and risk, respectively. They demonstrate that direct tie asymmetry has an inverted U-shaped effect on the focal firm’s abnormal returns and a U-shaped effect on its risk. Indirect tie asymmetry also has a U-shaped effect on the focal firm’s risk. However, the focal firm’s innovation quality and preexisting ties with its partner flatten these curvilinear effects. The findings have implications for partner selection in new product alliances.

675,"For brands to thrive, they must understand consumer sentiment; if consumers’ likelihood of sharing their opinion is a function of their attitude toward a brand, then brands’ perception of consumer sentiment may be systematically biased. While research in consumer-to-consumer sharing (i.e., word of mouth) suggests that those with extreme attitude are more likely to share than those with neutral attitude (a U-shaped relationship), the relationship between consumers’ attitude toward a brand and their propensity to share with a brand is unknown. In contrast to the U-shaped pattern observed in word of mouth, the authors find a hockey stick–shaped relationship between attitude and sharing with brands (“__/”). Those with positive attitude (vs. neutral attitude) are more likely to share their opinion, but those with negative attitude do not show a similar increase in sharing. The authors show that this pattern emerges because, among consumers with positive (vs. neutral) attitude toward a brand, reciprocity norms drive increased sharing, but among consumers with negative (vs. neutral) attitude, competing mechanisms drive behavior: the desire to vent increases sharing, but at the same time an aversion to criticize others directly deters sharing. The authors test these ideas using a series of studies, including a field study.

676,"The role of culture in consumers’ price search and behavior has received limited attention in the literature. In the present research, the authors examine how the cultural dimension of power distance belief (PDB)—the extent to which people accept and endorse hierarchy—influences consumers’ price sensitivity. The authors propose that consumers high (vs. low) in PDB are less price sensitive because they have a higher need for closure, which motivates them to “seize and freeze” on a current offer and quickly arrive at the final purchase decision rather than search for a better price. Accordingly, the relationship between PDB and price sensitivity is moderated by variables that alter consumers’ need for closure, such as social density. Six studies (and five more summarized in the Web Appendices) using a variety of operationalizations of the key variables provide robust support for the relationship between PDB and price sensitivity and shed light on the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

677,"Managers often use music as a marketing tool. For example, in advertising, they use music to intensify emotions; in service settings, they use slow music to boost relaxation and classical music to convey sophistication. In this article, the authors posit a novel effect—higher-pitched music can boost healthier choices. Recognizing that many perceptual characteristics of higher pitch (e.g., lighter, elevated) are conceptually associated with morality, they theorize that listening to higher- (vs. lower-) pitched music can cue morality. Furthermore, thoughts about morality can prompt moral self-perceptions and, in turn, thoughts about “good” behaviors, including healthy choices. Thus, listening to higher-pitched music may increase healthier choices. Employing field settings and online studies, the authors find that listening to higher-pitched music increases consumers’ likelihood to choose healthy options (Studies 1, 3, and 5), choose lower-calorie foods (Study 2), and engage in health-boosting activities (Study 4). This effect arises because high pitch raises the salience of morality thoughts (Studies 4 and 5). The article concludes with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications.

679,"Changes in the way customers shop, accompanied by an explosion of customer touchpoints and fast-changing competitive and technological dynamics, have led to an increased emphasis on agile marketing. The objective of this article is to conceptualize and investigate the emerging concept of marketing agility. The authors synthesize the literature from marketing and allied disciplines and insights from in-depth interviews with 22 senior managers. Marketing agility is defined as the extent to which an entity rapidly iterates between making sense of the market and executing marketing decisions to adapt to the market. It is conceptualized as occurring across different organizational levels and shown to be distinct from related concepts in marketing and allied fields. The authors highlight the firm challenges in executing marketing agility, including ensuring brand consistency, scaling agility across the marketing ecosystem, managing data privacy concerns, pursuing marketing agility as a fad, and hiring marketing leaders. The authors identify the antecedents of marketing agility at the organizational, team, marketing leadership, and employee levels and provide a roadmap for future research. The authors caution that marketing agility may not be well-suited for all firms and all marketing activities.

680,"When customers journey from a need to a purchase decision and beyond, they rarely do so alone. This article introduces the social customer journey, which extends prior perspectives on the path to purchase by explicitly integrating the important role that social others play throughout the journey. The authors highlight the importance of “traveling companions,” who interact with the decision maker through one or more phases of the journey, and they argue that the social distance between the companion(s) and the decision maker is an important factor in how social influence affects that journey. They also consider customer journeys made by decision-making units consisting of multiple individuals and increasingly including artificial intelligence agents that can serve as surrogates for social others. The social customer journey concept integrates prior findings on social influences and customer journeys and highlights opportunities for new research within and across the various stages. Finally, the authors discuss several actionable marketing implications relevant to organizations’ engagement in the social customer journey, including managing influencers, shaping social interactions, and deploying technologies.

681,"Omnichannel marketing is often viewed as the panacea for one-to-one marketing, but this strategic path is mired with obstacles. This article investigates three challenges in realizing the full potential of omnichannel marketing: (1) data access and integration, (2) marketing attribution, and (3) consumer privacy protection. While these challenges predate omnichannel marketing, they are exacerbated in a digital omnichannel environment. This article argues that advances in machine learning and blockchain offer some promising solutions. In turn, these technologies present new challenges and opportunities for firms, which warrant further academic research. The authors identify both recent developments in practice and promising avenues for future research.
","The emergence of digital platforms has led to a growing number of innovative and innovative solutions for business and social problems. However, the underlying mechanisms underlying these solutions remain unclear. This paper investigates the role of digital platforms in the development of innovative solutions for business and social problems. We propose a novel framework that integrates the two dimensions of innovation and social innovation: the ability to innovate and the ability to innovate in a digital environment. We find that the ability to innovate in a digital environment is a key driver of innovation and social innovation. We also find that the ability to innovate in a digital environment is a key driver of social innovation. Our findings contribute to the literature on digital platforms and their impact on business and social problems.  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \",0.3429861,-0.057055466,-1.8303554,-0.43179503,-0.32384497,0.01228762,-0.65653914,2.1633334,-0.66520536,1.6926401,0.50973463,-0.65780216,-0.5431106,-0.2277164,-0.009284498,1.1864628,-1.0125573,0.080066904,-0.39341497,-0.6012918,0.24832888,-0.7650683,-0.5876455,0.19178367,0.24631995,-0.30244514,0.044583768,-0.20516042,0.6795585,0.14322656,-0.26632664,-0.7759108,0.03270281,-0.2869727,-1.2082263,-0.8698472,-0.45428553,0.39824358,-0.4644476,-0.7323238,0.4983775,1.0615817,-0.71294266,1.1238896,-1.0231705,-0.51083213,0.024569023,0.67791116,0.6408723,0.1392256,0.26358116,0.46764418,-0.5897061,0.14091888,-0.123735085,-0.95475316,-0.56552523,0.057353947,0.43419594,0.108178094,-0.5902458,0.6390903,1.2193216,0.17231235,-0.33498803,-0.05855831,0.02873425,0.32900342,-0.7145848,0.7038978,0.01733408,2.0849316,0.021004202,-1.1094044,-0.5312088,1.2164321,-0.19409324,-0.88212955,0.4491149,1.1647199,2.0261443,-0.145124,-1.2365509,1.0010757e-05,-1.4442431,0.937388,-0.4323504,0.43898186,-1.0618501,-0.6383817,-1.0465215,-0.26967493,0.37529206,0.21823405,0.8739688,0.024493605,0.603643,-0.11534258,0.32791582,1.0868324,-1.6104,-0.46477026,0.5266005,1.0722259,-1.0526246,-0.05455818,-0.2451017,0.7256057,-0.4446277,0.6617073,0.73767734,-0.65668553,0.37470177,-0.63921463,1.0635402,0.011402641,-0.50067264,-0.48096842,-0.8891625,2.3390102,-0.38389778,-0.6888742,-1.1384546,0.10006504,-1.3067732,-0.49030143,-0.07447656,0.22341384
682,"Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to consumers, such as health monitoring with wearable devices, advice with recommender systems, peace of mind with smart household products, and convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations’ investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.

683,"Marketing is the functional area primarily responsible for driving the organic growth of a firm. In the age of digital marketing and big data, marketers are inundated with increasingly rich data from an ever-expanding array of sources. Such data may help marketers generate insights about customers and competitors. One fundamental question remains: How can marketers wrestle massive flows of existing and nascent data resources into coherent, effective growth strategies? Against such a backdrop, the Marketing Science Institute has made “capturing information to fuel growth” a top research priority. The authors begin by discussing the streetlight effect—an overreliance on readily available data due to ease of measurement and application—as contributing to the disconnect between marketing data growth and firm growth. They then use the customer equity framework to structure the discussion of six areas where they see substantial undertapped opportunities: incorporating social network and biometric data in customer acquisition, trend and competitive interaction data in customer development, and unstructured and causal data in customer retention. The authors highlight challenges that obstruct firms from realizing such data-driven growth opportunities and how future research may help overcome those challenges.

684,"Technological innovations are creating new products, services, and markets that satisfy enduring consumer needs. These technological innovations create value for consumers and firms in many ways, but they also disrupt psychological ownership––the feeling that a thing is “MINE.” The authors describe two key dimensions of this technology-driven evolution of consumption pertaining to psychological ownership: (1) replacing legal ownership of private goods with legal access rights to goods and services owned and used by others and (2) replacing “solid” material goods with “liquid” experiential goods. They propose that these consumption changes can have three effects on psychological ownership: they can threaten it, cause it to transfer to other targets, and create new opportunities to preserve it. These changes and their effects are organized in a framework and examined across three macro trends in marketing: (1) growth of the sharing economy, (2) digitization of goods and services, and (3) expansion of personal data. This psychological ownership framework generates future research opportunities and actionable marketing strategies for firms aiming to preserve the positive consequences of psychological ownership and navigate cases for which it is a liability.

685,"Firms are exploiting artificial intelligence (AI) coaches to provide training to sales agents and improve their job skills. The authors present several caveats associated with such practices based on a series of randomized field experiments. Experiment 1 shows that the incremental benefit of the AI coach over human managers is heterogeneous across agents in an inverted-U shape: whereas middle-ranked agents improve their performance by the largest amount, both bottom- and top-ranked agents show limited incremental gains. This pattern is driven by a learning-based mechanism in which bottom-ranked agents encounter the most severe information overload problem with the AI versus human coach, while top-ranked agents hold the strongest aversion to the AI relative to a human coach. To alleviate the challenge faced by bottom-ranked agents, Experiment 2 redesigns the AI coach by restricting the training feedback level and shows a significant improvement in agent performance. Experiment 3 reveals that the AI–human coach assemblage outperforms either the AI or human coach alone. This assemblage can harness the hard data skills of the AI coach and soft interpersonal skills of human managers, solving both problems faced by bottom- and top-ranked agents. These findings offer novel insights into AI coaches for researchers and managers alike.

686,"How can consumers be encouraged to take better care of public goods? Across four studies, including two experiments in the field and three documenting actual behaviors, the authors demonstrate that increasing consumers’ individual psychological ownership facilitates stewardship of public goods. This effect occurs because feelings of ownership increase consumers’ perceived responsibility, which then leads to active behavior to care for the good. Evidence from a variety of contexts, including a public lake with kayakers, a state park with skiers, and a public walking path, suggests that increasing psychological ownership enhances both effortful stewardship, such as picking up trash from a lake, and financial stewardship, such as donating money. This work further demonstrates that the relationship between psychological ownership and resulting stewardship behavior is attenuated when there are cues, such as an attendance sign, which diffuse responsibility among many people. This work offers implications for consumers, practitioners, and policy makers with simple interventions that can encourage consumers to be better stewards of public goods.

687,"The sharing economy has radically reshaped marketing thought and practice, and research has yet to examine whether and how platform-level buyer protection insurance (PPI) affects buyers and sellers in this economy. The authors exploit a natural experiment involving an unexpected system glitch during a PPI launch and estimate difference-in-differences models using over 5.4 million data points from a food sharing platform. Results suggest that PPI significantly increases buyer spending and seller revenue, affirming the benefits of this platform-level insurance in the sharing economy. The authors also uncover multifaceted buyer-side and seller-side responses that enable such benefits. PPI increases buyer spending by boosting product orders and variety-seeking behavior. Furthermore, it enhances seller revenue by increasing customer retention and acquisition. This work contributes to the literature by (1) putting a spotlight on the topic of PPI, a platform governance policy that reduces consumer risks and improves the efficacy of sharing platforms; (2) accounting for how PPI alters buyer and seller behaviors on a platform; (3) addressing what types of buyers and sellers benefit more or less from PPI; and (4) offering guidance for managers to improve platform reputation, marketplace efficiency, and consumer welfare in the context of the sharing economy.

688,"A sizable portion of online movie reviews contain spoilers, defined as information that prematurely resolves plot uncertainty. In this research, the authors study the consequences of spoiler reviews using data on box office revenue and online word of mouth for movies released in the United States. To capture the degree of information in spoiler review text that reduces plot uncertainty, the authors propose a spoiler intensity metric and measure it using a correlated topic model. Using a dynamic panel model with movie fixed effects and instrumental variables, the authors find a significant and positive relationship between spoiler intensity and box office revenue with an elasticity of .06. The positive effect of spoiler intensity is greater for movies with a limited release, smaller advertising spending, and moderate user ratings, and is stronger in the earlier days after the movie’s release. Using an event study and online experiments, the authors provide further evidence that spoiler reviews can help consumers reduce their uncertainty about the quality of movies, consequently encouraging theater visits. Thus, movie studios may benefit from consumers’ access to plot-intense reviews and should actively monitor the content of spoiler reviews to better forecast box office performance.

689,"When should business-to-business firms encourage their salespeople to advocate for the customer in pricing negotiations? This research extends dual agency theory to the sales domain to address this question. In Study 1, the authors examine discount negotiations with secondary data from a major U.S. distributor. They find that the customer and seller both experience the most favorable outcomes when the salesperson advocates strongly for both parties; advocacy for either party alone is counterproductive. Study 2 confirms these results using matched survey, pricing, and profit data and demonstrates a key boundary condition: broad customer–seller ties enable the synergy between customer advocacy and seller advocacy by enhancing the firms’ abilities to monitor the salesperson. In Study 3, experiments with business-to-business buyers replicate key findings and provide evidence for theorized mechanisms. This research emphasizes the interdependence between the salesperson’s dual roles and demonstrates how the salesperson can serve as an effective agent of both the customer and seller, thereby mitigating challenges associated with role conflict.

690,"The authors address the challenges individuals face when managing their professional brands while working in “prestigious posts” (high-profile jobs in established organizations) and striving to maintain career mobility. Using a case study approach and drawing on sociological field theories, the authors identify two types of tensions (resource-based and identity-based) that are triggered by prestigious posts and four practices conducive to mitigating tensions and maintaining mobility. Beyond extending prior theory on person brands to include consideration of career mobility, this work has implications for better understanding the complexities of affiliations between professionals and the brands they work for. It suggests that individuals who are managing their professional brands while holding prestigious posts need to strike a balance between benefiting from the affiliation in the eyes of external stakeholders and at the same time maintaining their professional independence to maintain career mobility.

691,"Marketers frequently style food to look pretty (e.g., in advertising). This article investigates how pretty aesthetics (defined by classical aesthetic principles, such as order, symmetry, and balance) influence healthiness judgments. The author proposes that prettier food is perceived as healthier, specifically because classical aesthetic features make it appear more natural. In a pilot, six main studies and four supplemental studies (total N = 4,301) across unhealthy and healthy, processed and unprocessed, and photographed and real foods alike, people judged prettier versions of the same food as healthier (e.g., more nutrients, less fat), despite equal perceived price. Even given financial stakes, people were misled by prettiness. In line with the proposed naturalness process, perceived naturalness mediated the effect; belief in a “natural = healthy” connection moderated it; expressive aesthetics, which do not evoke naturalness, did not produce the effect (despite being pretty); and reminders of artificial modification, which suppress perceived naturalness, mitigated it. Given that pretty food styling can harm consumers by misleading healthiness judgments for unhealthy foods, managers and policy makers should consider modification disclaimers as a tool to mitigate the “pretty = healthy” bias.

692,"Can low-cost marketing tools that are used to enhance business performance also contribute to creating a better world? The authors investigate the role of online social media tools in alleviating customer (farmer) uncertainty and promoting the adoption of a new eco-friendly pesticide in rural China via a randomized controlled field experiment. The key finding is that even for a new product such as a pesticide, a low-cost social media support platform can effectively promote adoption. A combination of information from peers and from the firm on the platform facilitates learning about product features and alleviates uncertainty associated with product quality and appropriate product usage. Nevertheless, at the trial stage of the funnel, the platform underperforms the firm’s customized one-on-one support because available information does not resolve uncertainty in supplier credibility and product authenticity. Having an influencer on the platform, albeit not an expert on this product, vouching for its credibility helps resolve this funnel-holdup problem. From a theoretical perspective, this paper provides suggestive evidence for referent influence and credibility signaling on social media platforms and consequences for new product trial. The authors also provide direct empirical evidence on how information facilitates learning, a phenomenon typically assumed to be present in studies estimating learning models.

693,"The authors propose that purchasing luxury can be a unique means to engage in sustainable consumption because high-end products are particularly durable. Six studies examine the sustainability of high-end products, investigate consumers’ decision making when considering high-end versus ordinary goods, and identify effective marketing strategies to emphasize product durability, an important and valued dimension of sustainable consumption. Real-world data on new and secondhand accessories demonstrate that high-end goods can be more sustainable than mid-range products because they have a longer life cycle. Furthermore, consumers engage in more sustainable behaviors with high-end goods, owning them for longer and disposing of them in more environmentally friendly manners. Nevertheless, many consumers prefer to concentrate their budget on multiple ordinary goods in lieu of fewer high-end products partly because of product durability neglect, a failure to consider how long a product will last. Although consumers generally believe that high-end products last longer, they fail to take such a notion into account when making purchases. Finally, this research offers actionable strategies for marketers to help consumers overcome product durability neglect and nudge them toward concentrating their budget on fewer high-end, durable products.

694,"Given the increasingly grave environmental crisis, governments and organizations frequently initiate sustainability interventions to encourage sustainable behavior in individual consumers. However, prevalent behavioral approaches to sustainability interventions often have the unintended consequence of generating consumer resistance, undermining their effectiveness. With a practice–theoretical perspective, the authors investigate what generates consumer resistance and how it can be reduced, using consumer responses to a nationwide ban on plastic bags in Chile in 2019. The findings show that consumer resistance to sustainability interventions emerges not primarily because consumers are unwilling to change their individual behavior—as the existing literature commonly assumes—but because the individual behaviors being targeted are embedded in dynamic social practices. When sustainability interventions aim to change individual behaviors rather than social practices, they place excessive responsibility on consumers, unsettle their practice-related emotionality, and destabilize the multiple practices that interconnect to shape consumers’ lives, ultimately leading to resistance. The authors propose a theory of consumer resistance in social practice change that explains consumer resistance to sustainability interventions and ways of reducing it. They also offer recommendations for policy makers and social marketers in designing and managing sustainability initiatives that trigger less consumer resistance and thereby foster sustainable consumer behavior.

695,"Food producers and retailers throw away large amounts of perfectly edible produce that fails to meet appearance standards, contributing to the environmental issue of food waste. The authors examine why consumers discard aesthetically unattractive produce, and they test a low-cost, easy-to-implement solution: emphasizing the produce’s aesthetic flaw through “ugly” labeling (e.g., labeling cucumbers with cosmetic defects “Ugly Cucumbers” on store displays or advertising). Seven experiments, including two conducted in the field, demonstrate that “ugly” labeling corrects for consumers’ biased expectations regarding key attributes of unattractive produce—particularly tastiness—and thus increases purchase likelihood. “Ugly” labeling is most effective when associated with moderate (rather than steep) price discounts. Against managers’ intuition, it is also more effective than alternative labeling that does not exclusively point out the aesthetic flaw, such as “imperfect” labeling. This research provides clear managerial recommendations on the labeling and the pricing of unattractive produce while addressing the issue of food waste.

696,"Promoting growth by differentiating products is a core tenet of marketing. However, establishing and quantifying marketing’s causal impact on firm growth, while critical, can be difficult. This article examines the effects of a business support intervention in which international professionals from different functional backgrounds (e.g., marketing, consulting) volunteered time to help Ugandan entrepreneurs improve growth. Findings from a multiyear field experiment show that entrepreneurs who were randomly matched with volunteer marketers significantly increased firm growth: on average, monthly sales grew by 51.7%, monthly profits improved by 35.8%, total assets increased by 31.0%, and number of paid employees rose by 23.8%. A linguistic analysis of interactions between volunteers and entrepreneurs indicates that the marketers spent more time on product-related topics than other volunteers. Further mechanism analyses indicate that the marketers helped the entrepreneurs focus on premium products to differentiate in the marketplace. In line with the study’s process evidence, firms with greater market knowledge or resource availability benefited significantly more than their peers when matched with volunteer marketers. As small-scale businesses form the commercial backbone of most emerging markets, their performance and development are critically important. Marketers’ positive impact on these businesses highlights the need for the field’s increased presence in emerging markets.

697,"People around the world are not saving enough money. The authors propose that one reason people undersave is because they hold the positive illusion of being financially responsible. If this conjecture is correct, then deflating this inflated self-view may increase saving, as people should become motivated to restore perceptions of financial responsibility. After establishing that people do hold the illusion of financial responsibility, the authors developed an intervention that combats this self-enhancing bias by triggering people to recognize their frequent engagement in superfluous spending. This superfluous-spender intervention increased saving by enhancing people’s motivation to restore their diminished perceptions of financial responsibility. Consistent with theorizing, the intervention increased saving only when superfluous spending was under one’s control and among those who were motivated to perceive themselves as financially responsible. In addition to increasing saving in Western countries, the superfluous-spender intervention increased saving of earned income and a financial windfall over time among chronically poor coffee growers in rural Uganda. Collectively, this work shows that people view their financial responsibility through rose-colored glasses, which can undermine their financial well-being. It also endows stakeholders with a simple, practical, and inexpensive intervention that offsets this bias to increase personal savings.

698,"Multinational companies increasingly focus on subsistence marketplaces, given their enormous market potential. Nevertheless, their potential is untapped because subsistence consumers face extreme constraints. The authors contend that subsistence consumers need marketplace literacy to participate effectively and beneficially in marketplaces. Marketplace literacy entails the knowledge and skills that enable them to participate in a marketplace as both consumers and entrepreneurs. This is crucial for subsistence consumers, as they often must function in both roles to survive. Previous research, however, has not empirically examined the influence of marketplace literacy on well-being or marketing outcomes related to well-being. To address this gap, the authors implemented three large-scale field experiments with approximately 1,000 people in 34 remote villages in India and Tanzania. They find that marketplace literacy causes an increase in psychological well-being and consumer outcomes related to well-being (e.g., consumer confidence, decision-making ability), especially for subsistence consumers with lower marketplace access, and it causes an increase in entrepreneurial outcomes related to well-being (e.g., starting a microenterprise) for those with higher marketplace access. Overall, this research generates practical implications for the use of marketplace literacy as a pathway to a better world.

699,"Positive effects of incentives on salespeople’s motivation, effort, and performance are well-established in literature. This article takes a novel look at their influence on salespeople’s health. The results of four empirical studies, including more than 1,400 salespeople, suggest that an increasing variable compensation share (i.e., greater pay-for-performance component in salespeople’s compensation plans) increases salespeople’s stress, resulting in emotional exhaustion and more sick days. These outcomes are more likely for salespeople with lower personal ability and fewer social resources. The harmful effects of the variable compensation share on salespeople’s health reduce the positive effects of this incentive on sales performance. To practice better marketing for a better world, if variable compensation is used, the authors recommend that managers screen new hires for job-related resources and help their existing staff build such resources. In addition, companies may personalize incentive schemes and sensitize managers to the stress-inducing effects of variable compensation shares.

700,"The prevalence of strong brands such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Budweiser, and Marlboro in “vice” categories has important implications for regulators and consumers. While researchers in multiple disciplines have studied the effectiveness of antitobacco countermarketing strategies, little attention has been given to how brand strength may moderate the efficacy of tactics such as excise taxes, usage restrictions, and educational advertising campaigns. In this research, the authors use a multiple discrete-continuous model to study the impact of antismoking techniques on smokers’ choices of brands and quantities. The results suggest that although cigarette excise taxes decrease smoking rates, these taxes also result in a shift in market share toward stronger brands. Market leaders may be less affected by tax policies because their market power allows strong brands such as Marlboro to absorb rather than pass through increased taxes. In contrast, smoke-free restrictions cause a shift away from stronger brands. In terms of antismoking advertising, the authors find minimal effects on brand choice and consumption. The findings highlight the importance of considering brand asymmetries when designing a policy portfolio on cigarette tax hikes, smoke-free restrictions, and antismoking advertising campaigns.

701,"Although prior research has advanced our understanding of the drivers of organ donation attitudes and intentions, little is known about how to increase actual registrations within explicit consent systems. Some empirical evidence suggests that costly, labor-intensive educational programs and mass-media campaigns might increase registrations; however, they are neither scalable nor economical solutions. To address these limitations, the authors conducted a field experiment (N = 3,330) in Ontario, Canada, testing the effectiveness of behaviorally informed promotion interventions as well as process improvements. They find that intercepting customers with materials targeting information and altruistic motives at the right time, along with streamlining customer service, significantly increased registrations. Specifically, the best-performing intervention, prompting perspective taking through reciprocal altruism (“If you needed a transplant would you have one?”), significantly increased new registration rates from 4.1% in the control condition to 7.4%. The authors followed up with seven posttests (total N = 3,376) to find support for their theoretical predictions and to explore the mechanisms through which the interventions may have operated. This article provides evidence for low-cost, scalable marketing solutions that increase organ donor registrations in a prompted choice context and has important implications for public policy and societal welfare.

702,"To fight obesity and educate consumers on how the human body functions, health education and marketing materials often highlight the importance of adopting a cognitive approach to food. One strategy employed to promote this approach is to portray humans as machines. Five studies (and three replication and follow-up studies) using different human-as-machine stimuli (internal body composition, face, appearance, and physical movement) revealed divergent effects of human-as-machine representations. While these stimuli promoted healthier choices among consumers who were high in eating self-efficacy, they backfired among consumers who were low in eating self-efficacy (measured in Studies 1 and 3–5; manipulated in Study 2). This reversal happened because portraying humans as machines activated consumers’ expectation of adopting a cognitive, machine-like approach to food (Studies 3 and 4)—an expectation that was too difficult to meet for those with low (vs. high) eating self-efficacy. We tested a solution to accompany human-as-machine stimuli in the field (Study 5): we externally enhanced how easy and doable it was for consumers low in eating self-efficacy to adopt a cognitive approach to food, which effectively attenuated the backfire effect on their lunch choices at a cafeteria.

703,"Prior approaches that leverage identity to motivate prosocial behavior are often limited to the set of people who already strongly identify with an organization (e.g., prior donors) or by the costs and challenges associated with developing stronger organization-linked identities among a broader audience (e.g., encouraging more people to care). In contrast, this research demonstrates that small prosocial gifts, such as tips or small donations, can be encouraged by framing the act of giving as an opportunity to express identity-relevant preferences—even if such preferences are not explicitly related to prosociality or the organization in need. Rather than simply asking people to give, the “dueling preferences” approach investigated in this research frames the act of giving as a choice between two options (e.g., cats vs. dogs, chocolate vs. vanilla ice cream). Dueling preferences increases prosocial giving by providing potential givers with a greater opportunity for self-expression—an intrinsically desirable opportunity. Seven experiments conducted in the laboratory, online, and in the field support this theorized process while casting doubt on relevant alternatives. This research contributes to work on self-expression and identity and sheds light on how organizations can encourage prosocial behavior.

704,"Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) play a central role in many economies in the form of private entities serving a public purpose. Strengthening the fundraising capabilities of NPOs can have a large impact on their survival and effective functioning. NPOs typically elicit financial contributions through multiple forms of giving, such as donation and membership. These options enable individuals to express their altruism by giving in one or multiple forms. The authors develop a utility-based multiple discrete-continuous model that provides insights into potentially large differences in individuals’ giving behaviors. Through Bayesian Gaussian processes, the model also incorporates changes in givers’ preferences for forms of giving. The authors apply their model to five years of individual giving data. They find that the effects of lifetime, recency, seasonality, and appeals on donation and membership options change nonmonotonically over time and in distinctive ways. The authors demonstrate that the model estimates help predict who will give in more than one form in the future as well as build appeal targeting strategies. The model also shows that fundraising attempts should emphasize participation rather than amount, and that long-lapsed members are still worth pursuing for renewal, whereas long-lapsed donors are less productive for repeat giving.

705,"Despite growing concerns regarding the increasing consumerism related to promotions, this research documents a positive effect of price promotions on consumers’ donation behavior. Specifically, the authors propose that price promotions increase consumers’ perceived resources, which in turn increase consumers’ donation behavior. A series of seven studies, combining field and experimental data, provide converging support for this proposition and its underlying mechanism of perceived resources. Furthermore, the authors show that the positive effect of price promotions on consumers’ donation behavior is attenuated when consumers focus on the amount of money spent (rather than saved), when consumers feel they have overspent their budget, and when the monetary savings cannot be realized immediately. Finally, the authors show that this effect is stronger when donation solicitation occurs immediately after the price promotion (vs. after a delay). This research documents a novel behavioral consequence of price promotions and uncovers a mechanism by which price promotions can lead to positive social consequences and contribute to a better world.

706,"The literature is filled with numerous idiosyncratic definitions of what it means for consumption to be authentic. The authors address the resulting conceptual ambiguity by reconceptualizing authenticity, defining it as a holistic consumer assessment determined by six component judgments (accuracy, connectedness, integrity, legitimacy, originality, and proficiency) whereby the role of each component can change according to the consumption context. This definition emerges from a two-stage, multimethod concept reconstruction process leveraging data from more than 3,000 consumers across no fewer than 17 types of consumption experiences. In stage one, the authors take a qualitative approach employing both in-depth interviews and surveys (one conducted on a nationally representative sample) to identify authenticity’s six constituent components. The final components are based on themes emerging from consumer data that were integrated and reconciled with existing definitions in the literature. In stage two, quantitative analyses empirically estimate the six components and support the composite formative nature of the construct. The authors document how certain components contribute to assessments of authenticity differently across contexts; in addition, they show that authenticity has consumer-relevant downstream consequences while being conceptually distinct from consumer attitudes. Their findings offer practitioners direction regarding what to emphasize to convey authenticity to consumers.

707,"How can we know what stakeholders think and feel about brands in real time and over time? Most brand reputation measures are at the aggregate level (e.g., the Interbrand “Best Global Brands” list) or rely on customer brand perception surveys on a periodical basis (e.g., the Y&R Brand Asset Valuator). To answer this question, brand reputation measures must capture the voice of the stakeholders (not just ratings on brand attributes), reflect important brand events in real time, and connect to a brand’s financial value to the firm. This article develops a new social media–based brand reputation tracker by mining Twitter comments for the world’s top 100 brands using Rust–Zeithaml–Lemon’s value–brand–relationship framework, on a weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis. The article demonstrates that brand reputation can be monitored in real time and longitudinally, managed by leveraging the reciprocal and virtuous relationships between the drivers, and connected to firm financial performance. The resulting measures are housed in an online longitudinal database and may be accessed by brand reputation researchers.

708,"Understanding consumers’ associations with brands is at the core of brand management. However, measuring associations is challenging because consumers can associate a brand with many objects, emotions, activities, sceneries, and concepts. This article presents an elicitation platform, analysis methodology, and results on consumer associations of U.S. national brands. The elicitation is direct, unaided, scalable, and quantitative and uses the power of visuals to depict a detailed representation of respondents’ relationships with a brand. The proposed brand visual elicitation platform allows firms to collect online brand collages created by respondents and analyze them quantitatively to elicit brand associations. The authors use the platform to collect 4,743 collages from 1,851 respondents for 303 large U.S. brands. Using unsupervised machine-learning and image-processing approaches, they analyze the collages and obtain a detailed set of associations for each brand, including objects (e.g., animals, food, people), constructs (e.g., abstract art, horror, delicious, famous, fantasy), occupations (e.g., musician, bodybuilder, baker), nature (e.g., beach, misty, snowscape, wildlife), and institutions (e.g., corporate, army, school). The authors demonstrate the following applications for brand management: obtaining prototypical brand visuals, relating associations to brand personality and equity, identifying favorable associations per category, exploring brand uniqueness through differentiating associations, and identifying commonalities between brands across categories for potential collaborations.

709,"Choice architecture tools, commonly known as nudges, powerfully impact decisions and can improve welfare. Yet it is unclear who is most impacted by nudges. If nudge effects are moderated by socioeconomic status (SES), these differential effects could increase or decrease disparities across consumers. Using field data and several preregistered studies, the authors demonstrate that consumers with lower SES, domain knowledge, and numerical ability are impacted more by a wide variety of nudges. As a result, “good nudges” designed to increase selection of superior options reduced choice disparities, improving choices more among consumers with lower SES, lower financial literacy, and lower numeracy than among those with higher levels of these variables. Compared with “good nudges,” “bad nudges” designed to facilitate selection of inferior options exacerbated choice disparities. These results generalized across real retirement decisions, different nudges, and different decision domains. Across studies, the authors tested different explanations of why SES, domain knowledge, and numeracy moderate nudges. The results suggest that nudges are a useful tool for those who wish to reduce disparities. The research concludes with a discussion of implications for marketing firms and segmentation.

710,"Many marketing transactions between buyers and suppliers involve short-term collaborations or so-called temporary organizations. Such organizations have considerable value-creation potential but also face challenges, as evidenced by their mixed performance records. One particular challenge involves relationship governance, and in this respect, temporary organizations represent a conundrum: On the one hand, they pose significant governance problems due to the need to manage numerous independent specialists under time constraints. On the other hand, temporary organizations lack the inherent governance properties of other organizational forms such as permanent organizations. The authors conduct an empirical study of 429 business-to-business construction projects designed to answer two specific questions: First, how are particular selection and pricing strategies deployed in response to monitoring and coordination problems? Second, does the joint alignment between the two mechanisms and their respective attributes help mitigate cost overruns? The authors follow a formal hypothesis test with a series of in-depth interviews to explore and to gain insight into the validity of the key constructs, explanatory mechanisms, and outcomes. Managerially, the authors answer the long-standing question of how to mobilize a temporary organization. Theoretically, they develop an augmented “discriminating alignment” heuristic for relationship management involving multiple governance mechanisms and attributes.

711,"The authors argue that appreciation of the biological underpinnings of human behavior can alter the beliefs and actions of multiple marketing stakeholders in ways that have immense welfare implications. However, a biological perspective often deviates from the lay perspective. The realization of improved welfare depends in part on narrowing this gap. The authors review biological evidence on self-control and report ten empirical studies that examine lay response to biological characterizations of self-control. The authors contrast lay response with scientific understanding and then offer implications of biology—as well as the gap between the scientific and lay perspectives—for policy makers, firms, consumers, marketing educators, and scholars. The authors also identify opportunities for future research. They conclude that marketing scholars can and should play an active role in narrowing the gap between the scientific and lay perspectives in the service of both theory development and human welfare.

712,"Consumers often abandon e-commerce carts, so companies are shifting their online advertising budgets to immediate e-commerce cart retargeting (ECR). They presume that early reminder ads, relative to late ones, generate more click-throughs and web revisits. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the double-edged effects of ECR ads and empirically support it with a multistudy, multisetting design. Study 1 involves two field experiments on over 40,500 customers who are randomized to either receive an ECR ad via email and app channels (treatment) or not receive it (control) across different hourly blocks after cart abandonment. The authors find that customers who received an early ECR ad within 30 minutes to one hour after cart abandonment are less likely to make a purchase compared with the control. These findings reveal a causal negative incremental impact of immediate retargeting. In other words, delivering ECR ads too early can engender worse purchase rates than without delivering them, thus wasting online advertising budgets. By contrast, a late ECR ad received one to three days after cart abandonment has a positive incremental impact on customer purchases. In Study 2, another field experiment on 23,900 customers not only replicates the double-edged impact of ECR ads delivered by mobile short message service but also explores cart characteristics that amplify both the negative impact of early ECR ads and positive impact of late ECR ads. These findings offer novel insights into customer responses to online retargeted ads for researchers and managers alike.

713,"Despite evidence that consumers appreciate freedom of choice, they also enjoy recommendation systems, subscription services, and marketplace encounters that seemingly occur by chance. This article proposes that enjoyment can, in some contexts, be higher than that in contexts involving choice. This occurs as a result of feelings of serendipity that arise when a marketplace encounter is positive, unexpected, and attributed to some degree of chance. A series of studies shows that feelings of serendipity positively influence an array of consumer outcomes, including satisfaction and enjoyment, perceptions of meaningfulness of an experience, likelihood of recommending a company, and likelihood of purchasing additional products from the company. The findings show that strategies based on serendipity are even more effective when consumers perceive that randomness played a role in how an encounter occurred, and not effective when the encounter is negative, the encounter occurs deterministically (i.e., planned by marketers to target consumers), and consumers perceive that they have enough knowledge to make their own choices. Altogether, this research suggests that marketers can influence customer satisfaction by structuring marketplace encounters to appear more serendipitous, as opposed to expected or entirely chosen by the consumer.
","We examine the impact of consumer choice on the purchase decision of a product. We find that consumers are more likely to purchase a product when they are uncertain about the quality of the product, and more likely to purchase a product when they are uncertain about the quality of the product.

714,"Many retailers are rushing into the click-and-collect (C&C) format, where shoppers place orders online and pick up the goods themselves later. The authors study the demand implications of C&C and postulate how different ways of organizing this format—each with its own convenience features—appeal to households with different shopper characteristics. Using two data sets, each covering the introduction of two C&C fulfillment types by a major grocery retailer in a large number of local markets, the authors compare the impact of in-store fulfillment (pickup at existing stores), near-store fulfillment (pickup at outlets adjoining stores), and stand-alone fulfillment (pickup at free-standing locations). The authors find that the shift in online consumer spending significantly differs between the three order fulfillment types, as does the impact on total spending. No one order fulfillment type systematically dominates; the effects depend heavily on shopper characteristics. The study’s results provide guidance on which C&C fulfillment type(s) to operate under what conditions and caution retailers not to take the easy in-store route routinely.

715,"Grounded in sociological agency theory, the authors study the role of the faculty research incentive system in the academic research conducted at business schools and business school health. The authors surveyed 234 marketing professors and completed 22 interviews with 14 (associate) deans and 8 external institution stakeholders. They find that research quantity contributes to the research health of the school, but not to other aspects of business school health. The r-quality of research (i.e., rigor) contributes more strongly to the research health of the school than research quantity. The q-quality (i.e., practical importance) of research does not contribute to the research health of the school but does contribute positively to teaching health and several other dimensions of business school health. The authors conclude that faculty research incentives are misaligned: (1) when monitoring research faculty, the number of publications receives too much weight, while creativity, literacy, relevance, and awards receive too little weight; and (2) faculty feel that they are insufficiently compensated for their research, while (associate) deans feel they are compensated too much for their research. These incentive misalignments are largest in schools that perform the worst on research (r- and q-) quality. The authors explore how business schools and faculty can remedy these misalignments.

716,"Using text-mining, the authors develop version 1.0 of the Relevance to Marketing (R2M) Index, a dynamic index that measures the topical and timely relevance of academic marketing articles to marketing practice. The index assesses topical relevance drawing on a dictionary of marketing terms derived from 50,000 marketing articles published in practitioner outlets from 1982 to 2019. Timely relevance is based on the prevalence of academic marketing topics in practitioner publications at a given time. The authors classify topics into four quadrants based on their low/high popularity in academia and practice —“Desert,” “Academic Island,” “Executive Fields,” and “Highlands”—and score academic articles and journals: Journal of Marketing has the highest R2M score, followed by Marketing Science, Journal of Marketing Research, and Journal of Consumer Research. The index correlates with practitioner judgments of practical relevance and other relevance measures. Because the index is a work in progress, the authors discuss how to overcome current limitations and suggest correlating the index with citation counts, altmetrics, and readability measures. Marketing practitioners, authors, and journal editors can use the index to assess article relevance, and academic administrators can use it for promotion and tenure decisions (see www.R2Mindex.com). The R2M Index is thus not only a measurement instrument but also a tool for change.

717,"Academia is a marketplace of ideas. Just as firms market their products with packaging and advertising, scholars market their ideas with writing. Even the best ideas will make an impact only if others understand and build on them. Why, then, is academic writing often difficult to understand? In two experiments and a text analysis of 1,640 articles in premier marketing journals, this research shows that scholars write unclearly in part because they forget that they know more about their research than readers, a phenomenon called “the curse of knowledge.” Knowledge, or familiarity with one’s own research, exacerbates three practices that make academic writing difficult to understand: abstraction, technical language, and passive writing. When marketing scholars know more about a research project, they use more abstract, technical, and passive writing to describe it. Articles with more abstract, technical, and passive writing are harder for readers to understand and are less likely to be cited. The authors call for scholars to overcome the curse of knowledge and provide two tools—a website (writingclaritycalculator.com) and a tutorial—to help them recognize and repair unclear writing so they can write articles that are more likely to make an impact.

718,"Consumers often observe how other consumers interact with brands to inform their own brand judgments. This research demonstrates that brand relationship quality–indicating cues, such as brand nicknames (e.g., “Mickey D’s” for McDonald’s, “Wally World” for Walmart), enhance perceived information authenticity in online communication. An analysis of historical Twitter data followed by six experiments (using both real and fictitious brands across different online platforms [e.g., online reviews, social media posts]) show that brand nickname use in user-generated content signals a writer’s relationship quality with the target brand from the reader’s perspective, which the authors term “inferred brand attachment.” The authors demonstrate that inferred brand attachment boosts perceived information authenticity and leads to positive downstream consequences, such as purchase willingness and information sharing. The authors also find that this effect is attenuated when brand nicknames are used in firm-generated content. How consumers’ relationships with brands are portrayed and perceived in a social context (e.g., via brand nickname use) serves as a novel context to examine user-generated content and provides valuable managerial insight regarding how to leverage consumers’ brand attachment cues in brand strategy and online information management.

719,"Algorithms, increasingly used by brands, sometimes fail to perform as expected or, even worse, cause harm, leading to brand harm crises. Algorithm failures are unfortunately increasing in frequency, yet little is known about consumers’ responses to brands following such crises. Extending developments in the theory of mind perception, the authors hypothesize that, following a brand harm crisis, consumers respond less negatively if the error was caused by an algorithm (vs. a human). The authors further hypothesize that consumers’ lower mind perception of agency of the algorithm (vs. a human), which lowers their perceptions of the algorithm’s responsibility for the harm, mediates this relationship. Four moderators of this relationship are hypothesized: two algorithm characteristics (whether the algorithm is anthropomorphized and whether it involves machine learning) and two characteristics of the task for which the algorithm is deployed (whether the task is subjective [vs. objective] and whether it is interactive [vs. noninteractive]). The authors find support for the hypotheses in eight experimental studies. The effects of two managerial interventions to manage brand harm crises caused by algorithm errors are examined. This research advances the literature on brand harm crises, algorithm usage, and algorithmic marketing and generates managerial guidelines to address such crises.

720,"While prevailing marketing practice is to encourage ever-stronger relationships between consumers and brands, such relationships are rare, and many consumers are relationship-averse or content with the status quo. The authors examine how marketers can more effectively manage existing brand relationships by focusing on the psychological distance between consumers and brands in order to match close (distant) brands with concrete (abstract) language in marketing communications. Through such matching, marketers can create a beneficial mindset-congruency effect leading to more favorable evaluations and behavior, even for brands that are relatively distant to consumers. Study 1 demonstrates the basic mindset-congruency effect, and Study 2 shows that it is capable of affecting donation behaviors. Study 3 documents two brand-level factors (search vs. experience goods, brand stereotypes) that moderate this effect in managerially relevant ways. Study 4 shows that activation of the mindset-congruency effect influences consumers to spend more and that these behaviors are moderated by consumer category involvement. The authors conclude with marketing and theoretical implications.

721,"Prior research indicates the strategic importance of the store environment in enhancing customers’ shopping experience and their purchase decisions. This article examines the effects of imaginative displays on customers’ purchase behavior. An imaginative display is constructed using multiple units of the same product in a novel or innovative yet aesthetically appealing form, which could be themed (i.e., having a particular shape mimicking an object) or unthemed. Six studies in both lab and field settings show that, relative to standard displays (i.e., non-novel and neutral aesthetics), imaginative displays can increase customers’ purchase behavior and intentions. Importantly, for themed imaginative displays, these effects work through the dual mechanisms of affect-based arousal and cognition-based inferred benefits, which are contingent on congruence between display form and perceived product benefit. Findings from this research not only contribute to the literature on in-store display and store atmospherics but also have significant practical implications for retailers. Specifically, while imaginative displays may appear gimmicky, they can favorably influence customers’ purchase behavior and increase product sales at relatively low costs.

722,"This research illustrates how marketing perks can be leveraged to spur WOM. Specifically, this research introduces a previously overlooked yet practically relevant dimension on which perks differ: “contractuality,” defined as the extent to which consumers perceive a perk to be conditional on specific behaviors and contingencies dictated by a company. Importantly, consumers can perceive the exact same perk as more versus less contractual depending on the way it is conferred, structured, or framed. This research demonstrates that low-contractuality perks can be more effective than high-contractuality perks at fostering WOM in the absence of explicit incentives to do so. In particular, low-contractuality perks are more likely than high-contractuality perks to convey a relational signal that motivates consumers to help the company by sharing WOM. Seven experiments, two of which were conducted in the field, support this hypothesis and illustrate conditions under which the effect attenuates or reverses. On the whole, this work offers insights into how managers might design interventions that foster WOM, and it reveals potential trade-offs of commonly used high-contractuality perks.

723,"Participative pricing strategies may influence consumer purchase decisions; this research proposes specifically that firms’ delegation of pricing decisions to consumers can create a control–effort trade-off. Consumers favor greater pricing control but are deterred by the effort involved in deciding what to pay. Strategies such as pay what you want in turn might reduce purchase intentions due to the effort involved. In contrast, strategies that increase feelings of control but not perceived effort, such as pick your price options that let consumers choose from a limited set of prices, could enhance pricing outcomes. A field study and four laboratory experiments confirm these propositions. The findings demonstrate the mixed effects of participative pricing, identify mediating mechanisms that explain these effects, and specify common moderating conditions that shape the outcomes of participative pricing. These results have notable implications for pricing theory and practice.

724,"Firms are increasingly turning to social media platforms for complaint handling. Previous research and practitioners’ reports highlight the benefits of complaint handling on social media, urging firms to provide prompt and detailed responses to complaints. However, little research has explored the possible drawbacks of such practices, especially when responses inadvertently further publicize complaints. Utilizing two unique data sets in a series of observational and quasiexperimental analyses, this research provides the first evidence of “complaint publicization” in social media, a phenomenon in which firm responses to complaints on popular social media platforms increase the potential public exposure of complaints. This negative effect can outweigh any positive customer care–signaling impact from firm responses. The authors show that a response strategy that engenders a high level of complaint publicization (e.g., providing detailed responses through multiple communication exchanges with a complainant) could negatively impact perceived quality and firm value, diminish the positive impact of a firm’s own posts, and increase the volume of future complaints. Additional analyses reveal that these adverse impacts are stronger for firms that are targeted by retail investors. The authors also uncover specific response strategies and styles that could mitigate these effects.

725,"This article adopts a marketing perspective to examine how wage inequality between top managers and their employees may have customer-related consequences (i.e., customer-directed effort, customer-directed opportunism, and customer-oriented culture) that affect customer satisfaction and firm performance. Surprisingly, marketing scholars and practitioners have largely neglected this pressing societal issue. The authors collect a cross-industry, multisource data set, including responses by top-level managers and objective data on wage inequality and firm performance from 106 business-to-business-focused firms (Study 1). In addition, they analyze multisource longitudinal panel data covering 521 firm-year observations for business-to-consumer-focused firms (Study 2). The results consistently reveal that wage inequality harms customer satisfaction. This relationship is mediated by customer-directed opportunism and customer-oriented culture but not customer-directed effort. Moreover, while wage inequality has a positive direct effect on short-term firm profitability, this effect is dampened by the negative indirect effect through customer-related consequences and customer satisfaction. Importantly, the positive direct effect of wage inequality on short-term profitability vanishes in the long run, whereas the adverse effect through customer satisfaction persists, leading to a nonsignificant total effect on long-term profitability. These findings may guide researchers, managers, shareholders, and policy makers in addressing the challenge of rising wage inequality.

726,"The authors investigate app publishers’ decisions to offer free, paid, or both versions of an app over an app’s lifetime by taking into account the interplays between the demand for the free and paid versions and publishers’ consideration of future profit streams. Their empirical analyses are based on a comprehensive model of publishers’ versioning decisions calibrated on a data set of 584 top-downloaded apps on Google Play. They find contemporaneous cannibalization but positive intertemporal cross-effects on new users’ demand between the two versions. In addition, the free version’s active user base and in-app purchase and advertising revenues are reduced by the presence of a paid version, but not vice versa. Among the three options, offering the paid version first is the most common optimal launch strategy and applies to 40% of apps in the data. The evolutionary patterns of optimal versioning decisions vary by app category and are related to apps’ abilities to monetize different revenue sources. This study provides insights on how to strategically manage the versioning decision over an app’s lifetime and shows how publishers can make their free version apps more profitable via the deployment or elimination of the paid version.

727,"Households that send members to work away from home often receive information about the lifestyles and consumption behaviors in those migration destinations (i.e., social remittances) along with money or goods (i.e., economic remittances). The authors investigate the effect of having a migrant household member on household brand expenditures in rural India, a market characterized by substantial consumption of unbranded products. They collect and analyze household-level survey data from 434 households across 30 villages using an instrumental variable strategy. Economic remittances result in greater brand expenditure, and this level is higher for poorer households. After controlling for economic remittances, the authors find that the effect of migration on brand expenditures is more positive for households in more populous villages, with greater access to mobile phones, lower viewership of television media, and less recently departed migrants. They demonstrate how marketing resource allocation across villages can be improved by incorporating migration data and provide insights for household targeting in the context of door-to-door selling in villages. The results are robust to alternative, public policy–based instruments and can be generalized to expenditure on private schools. Using additional survey data from 300 households in 62 new villages, the authors replicate the results by comparing within-households brand expenditures before and after the migration event.

728,"Advances in technology, particularly smartphones, have unlocked new opportunities for consumers to generate content about experiences while they unfold (e.g., by texting, posting to social media, writing notes), and this behavior has become nearly ubiquitous. The present research examines the effects of generating content during ongoing experiences. Across nine studies, the authors show that generating content during an experience increases feelings of immersion and makes time feel like it is passing more quickly, which in turn enhances enjoyment of the experience. The authors investigate these effects across a broad array of experiences both inside and outside the lab that vary in duration from a few minutes to several hours, including positive and negative videos and real-life holiday celebrations. They conclude with several studies testing marketing interventions that increase content creation and find that consumers who are incentivized or motivated by social norms to generate content reap the same experiential benefits as those who create content organically. These findings illustrate how leveraging content creation to improve experiences can mutually benefit marketers and consumers.

729,"A brand name’s linguistic characteristics convey brand qualities independent of the name’s denotative meaning. For instance, name length, sounds, and stress can signal masculine or feminine associations. This research examines the effects of such gender associations on three important brand outcomes: attitudes, choice, and performance. Across six studies, using both observational analyses of real brands and experimental manipulations of invented brands, the authors show that linguistically feminine names increase perceived warmth, which improves brand outcomes. Feminine brand names enhance attitudes and choice share—both hypothetically and consequentially—and are associated with better brand performance. The authors establish boundary conditions, showing that the feminine brand name advantage is attenuated when the typical user is male and when products are utilitarian.
","We propose that the relationship between the perceived attractiveness of a product and its perceived attractiveness is mediated by the perceived attractiveness of the product’s attributes. We find that perceived attractiveness of a product is positively related to the perceived attractiveness of its attributes. We also find that perceived attractiveness of a product’s attributes is positively related to the perceived attractiveness of its attributes. We further find that perceived attractiveness of a product’s attributes is positively related to the perceived attractiveness of its attributes. We discuss implications for research on product attributes and the design of product attributes.

730,"Using the informative view of advertising as their theoretical lens, the authors propose that advertising provides information to investors in financial markets, analogous to its role for customers in product markets. The authors extend previous marketing–finance research, which has focused on how advertising affects firms’ risk and returns, and investigate a novel outcome variable, stock price synchronicity. Consistent with their proposed theory, the authors find that firms that advertise more relative to competitors have lower stock price synchronicity, implying that these firms’ stock price movements are driven more by information that is specific to the firm rather than general industry- and market-wide trends. The effect of advertising investments on stock price synchronicity is moderated by the information demand versus supply about firms in financial markets given firms’ product characteristics and ownership structure, and the likelihood of spillover effects between product and financial markets given firms’ marketing strategies. The authors illustrate the relevance of their findings for marketing managers through an event study in which they demonstrate that firms with high stock price synchronicity are “tarred with the same brush” and experience negative abnormal returns when competitors have a product recall, whereas firms with low stock price synchronicity are not affected.

731,"The authors propose that the emotional intelligence–sales performance link can be better understood by considering a salesperson’s confidence in how they use emotions, known as emotional self-efficacy (ESE). Four multisource studies across diverse sales industries offer evidence of the interactive effect of a salesperson’s emotional intelligence and ESE—which the authors term “emotional calibration”—on salesperson performance. They find that sales performance suffers when salespeople are either overconfident or underconfident in their emotional skills and that salespeople perform best when they are calibrated. Further, the authors demonstrate that the performance gains associated with emotional calibration (1) are attenuated when salespeople are under stress and (2) occur because emotional calibration encourages positive avoidance emotions (calmness and relaxation) among salespeople that result in improved customer rapport, but only among salespeople with relatively longer job tenures. Overall, the research highlights the critical role of ESE as an essential but neglected aspect of a salesperson’s emotional competence.

732,"This research shows that spatial distance between visual representations of a product and consumers may enhance or devalue consumers’ perceptions of the brand depending on the brand image (prestigious vs. popular). The authors suggest that spatial distance signals prestige when status and luxury are relevant to the brand image, and decreased distance signals social closeness when popularity and broad appeal are relevant to the brand image. The authors show that for prestigious brands whose brand image is associated with status and luxury, consumers’ attitude toward the product becomes more favorable and their willingness to pay a premium for the product grows as the distance between the visual representations of the product and the consumer increases. In contrast, for popular brands whose brand image is associated with broad appeal and social connectedness, the closer the distance, the more favorable is consumers’ attitude and the higher their willingness to pay a premium. The findings provide useful guidelines to marketers on the use of visual cues in advertising and product displays.

733,"Advances in molecular genetics have led to the exponential growth of the direct-to-consumer genetic testing industry, resulting in the assembly of massive privately owned genetic databases. This article explores the potential impact of this new data type on the field of marketing. Drawing on findings from behavioral genetic research, the authors propose a framework that incorporates genetic influences into existing consumer behavior theory and use it to survey potential marketing uses of genetic data. Applications include business strategies that rely on genetic variants as bases for segmentation and targeting, creative uses that develop consumers’ sense of community and personalization, use of genetically informed study designs to test causal relations, and refinement of consumer theory by uncovering biological mechanisms underlying behavior. The authors further evaluate ethical challenges related to autonomy, privacy, misinformation, and discrimination that are unique to the use of genetic data and are not sufficiently addressed by current regulations. They conclude by proposing an agenda for future research.

734,"At the intersection of technology and marketing, this study develops a framework to unobtrusively detect salespeople’s faces and simultaneously extract six emotions: happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and disgust. The authors analyze 99,451 sales pitches on a livestream retailing platform and match them with actual sales transactions. Results reveal that each emotional display, including happiness, uniformly exhibits a negative U-shaped effect on sales over time. The maximum sales resistance appears in the middle rather than at the beginning or end of sales pitches. Taken together, the results show that in one-to-many screen-mediated communications, salespeople should sell with a straight face. In addition, the authors derive closed-form formulae for the optimal allocation of the presence of a face and emotional displays over the presentation span. In contrast to the U-shaped effects, the optimal face presence wanes at the start, gradually builds to a crescendo, and eventually ebbs. Finally, the study shows how to objectively rank salespeople and circumvent biases in performance appraisals, thereby making novel contributions to people analytics. This research integrates new types of data and methods, key theoretical insights, and important managerial implications to inform the expanding opportunity that livestream e-commerce presents to marketers to create, communicate, deliver, and capture value.

735,"The rise of augmented reality (AR) technology presents marketers with promising opportunities to engage customers and transform their brand experience. Although firms are keen to invest in AR, research documenting its tangible impact in real-world contexts is sparse. In this article, the authors outline four broad uses of the technology in retail settings. They then focus specifically on the use of AR to facilitate product evaluation prior to purchase and empirically investigate its impact on sales in online retail. Using data obtained from an international cosmetics retailer, they find that AR usage on the retailer’s mobile app is associated with higher sales for brands that are less popular, products with narrower appeal, and products that are more expensive. In addition, the effect of AR is stronger for customers who are new to the online channel or product category, suggesting that the sales increase is coming from online channel adoption and category expansion. These findings provide converging evidence that AR is most effective when product-related uncertainty is high, demonstrating the technology’s potential to increase sales by reducing uncertainty and instilling purchase confidence. To encourage more impactful research in this area, the authors conclude with a research agenda for AR in marketing.

736,"Avatars are becoming increasingly popular in contemporary marketing strategies, but their effectiveness for achieving performance outcomes (e.g., purchase likelihood) varies widely in practice. Related academic literature is fragmented, lacking both definitional consistency and conceptual clarity. This article makes three main contributions to avatar theory and managerial practice. First, to address ambiguity with respect to its definition, this study identifies and critically evaluates key conceptual elements of the term avatar, offers a definition derived from this analysis, and provides a typology of avatars’ design elements. Second, the proposed 2 × 2 avatar taxonomy suggests that the alignment of an avatar’s form realism and behavioral realism, across different contingencies, provides a parsimonious explanation for avatar effectiveness. Third, the authors develop an emerging theory of avatar marketing by triangulating insights from fundamental elements of avatars, a synthesis of extant research, and business practices. This framework integrates key theoretical insights, research propositions, and important managerial implications for this expanding area of marketing strategy. Lastly, the authors outline a research program to test the propositions and insights as well as advance future research.

737,"Rapid development and adoption of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing applications challenge managers and policy makers to harness these transformative technologies. In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel “word-of-machine” effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person’s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6). An intervention based on the consider-the-opposite protocol attenuates the word-of-machine effect (Studies 7a–b).

738,"Digital platforms that aggregate products and services, such as Google Shopping or Amazon, have emerged as powerful intermediaries to brand offerings, challenging traditional product brands that have largely lost direct access to consumers. As a countermeasure, several long-established brands have built their own flagship platforms to resume control and foster consumer loyalty. For example, sports brands such as Nike, Adidas, or Asics launched tracking and training platforms that allow for ongoing versatile interactions among participants beyond product purchase. The authors analyze these emerging platform offerings, whose potential brands struggle to exploit, and provide guidance for brands that aim to platformize their business. This guidance comprises the conceptualization of digital platforms as places of consumer crowdsourcing (i.e., consumers drawing value from platform participants such as the brand, other consumers, or third-party businesses) and crowdsending (i.e., consumers providing value to platform participants) of products, services, and content along with a well-defined framework that brands can apply to assemble different types of flagship platforms. Evaluating the consequences of crowdsourcing and crowdsending for consumer–platform relationships, the authors derive a typology of archetypical relationship states and develop a set of propositions to help offline-born product brands thrive through platformization.

739,"Chatbots have become common in digital customer service contexts across many industries. While many companies choose to humanize their customer service chatbots (e.g., giving them names and avatars), little is known about how anthropomorphism influences customer responses to chatbots in service settings. Across five studies, including an analysis of a large real-world data set from an international telecommunications company and four experiments, the authors find that when customers enter a chatbot-led service interaction in an angry emotional state, chatbot anthropomorphism has a negative effect on customer satisfaction, overall firm evaluation, and subsequent purchase intentions. However, this is not the case for customers in nonangry emotional states. The authors uncover the underlying mechanism driving this negative effect (expectancy violations caused by inflated pre-encounter expectations of chatbot efficacy) and offer practical implications for managers. These findings suggest that it is important to both carefully design chatbots and consider the emotional context in which they are used, particularly in customer service interactions that involve resolving problems or handling complaints.

740,"When faced with new technologies, the incumbents’ dilemma is whether to embrace the new technology, stick with their old technology, or invest in both. The entrants’ dilemma is whether to target a niche and avoid incumbent reaction or target the mass market and incur the incumbent’s wrath. The solution is knowing to what extent the new technology cannibalizes the old one or whether both technologies may exist in tandem. The authors develop a generalized model of the diffusion of successive technologies, which allows for the rate of disengagement from the old technology to differ from the rate of adoption of the new. A low rate of disengagement indicates people hold both technologies (coexistence), whereas a high rate of disengagement indicates they let go of the old technology in favor of the new (cannibalization). The authors test the validity of the model using a simulation of individual-level data. They apply the model to 660 technology pairs and triplets–country combinations from 108 countries spanning 70 years. Data include both penetration and sales plus important case studies. The model helps managers estimate evolving proportions of segments that play different roles in the competition between technologies and predict technological leapfrogging, cannibalization, and coexistence.

741,"Consumers are increasingly mindful of corporate social responsibility (CSR) when making purchase and consumption decisions, but evidence of the impact of CSR initiatives on actual purchase decisions is lacking. This article introduces a novel brand accountability–based framework of consumer response to CSR initiatives, which categorizes CSR efforts as “corrective,” “compensating,” or “cultivating goodwill.” Leveraging a database of CSR press releases by leading consumer packaged goods brands, the authors examine the effect of the different types of CSR announcements on brand sales. The findings suggest that CSR initiatives that genuinely aim to reduce a brand's negative externalities (“corrective” and “compensating”) lift sales, whereas CSR actions focused on philanthropy (“cultivating goodwill”) can hurt sales. The authors propose two moderators—CSR reputation and CSR focus on environmental or social causes—and a mechanism for these effects, which they examine under controlled experimental settings. The experimental results show that, conditional on CSR reputation, consumers perceive varying degrees of sincerity in the different CSR types and that sincerity mediates the effect of CSR type on purchase intentions. Overall, the results suggest that consumers are more inclined to reward firms that directly reduce the negative by-products of their own business practices than to be impressed by public goodwill gestures.

742,"Sharing economy platforms have become increasingly popular, but many platforms do not create all the value that is possible because consumers face challenges while cocreating their experiences. The authors situate the origin of these challenges in the sharing economy’s hybrid cocreation logics, which combine competing communal and transactional logics. Using a qualitative study of Couchsurfing, a platform for sharing free accommodation, the authors find that consumers engage in orchestration work to overcome cocreation roadblocks and extract greater benefits from sharing economy platforms. This orchestration work consists of many actions reflected in four overarching mechanisms: consumer-to-consumer alignment, rewiring relations, trust investment, and network experimentation. The authors connect these mechanisms to known sources of value for firms (i.e., complementarities, efficiency, lock-in, and novelty) to make recommendations for how platform firms can foster consumer orchestration work and unlock the full value of consumer cocreation in the sharing economy.

743,"U.S. households currently hold $770 billion in credit card debt, often managing repayments across multiple accounts. The authors investigate how minimum payment requirements (i.e., the requirement to allocate at least some money to each account with a balance) alter consumers’ allocation strategies across multiple accounts. Across four experiments, they find that minimum payment requirements cause consumers to increase dispersion (i.e., spread their repayments more evenly) across accounts. The authors term this change in strategy “the dispersion effect of minimum payments” and provide evidence that it can be costly for consumers. They find that the effect is partially driven by the tendency for consumers to interpret minimum payment requirements as recommendations to pay more than the minimum amount. While the presence of the minimum payment requirement is unlikely to change, the authors propose that marketers and policy makers can influence the effects of minimum payments on dispersion by altering the way that information is displayed to consumers. Specifically, they investigate five distinct information displays and find that choice of display can either exaggerate or minimize dispersion and corresponding costs. They discuss implications for consumers, policy makers, and firms, with a particular focus on ways to improve consumer financial well-being.

744,"Most researchers focus on the effect of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) on investor returns and overlook customer reactions, despite the fact that customers are directly impacted by these corporate transformations. Others suggest that in M&A contexts, a dual emphasis of customer satisfaction and firm efficiency is both likely and beneficial. In contrast, the authors demonstrate that M&As not only do not yield a dual emphasis but also cause a decline in customer satisfaction to the extent that they eclipse any gain in firm value from an increase in firm efficiency. A quasiexperimental difference-in-differences analysis and an instrumental variable panel regression provide robust evidence for the dark side of M&As for customers. The authors use the attention-based view of the firm to demonstrate that post-M&A customer dissatisfaction occurs because of a shift in executive attention away from customers and toward financial issues. In line with the related upper echelons theory, they find that marketing representation on a firm’s board of directors helps maintain executive attention on customers, which mitigates the dysfunctional effect of M&As on customer satisfaction. This research identifies a negative M&A–customer satisfaction relationship and highlights executive attention to customer issues and marketing leadership as factors that mitigate this negative relationship.

745,"A fundamental tension exists in creativity between novelty and similarity. This research exploits this tension to help creators craft successful projects in crowdfunding. To do so, the authors apply the concept of combinatorial creativity, analyzing each new project in connection to prior similar projects. By using machine learning techniques (Word2vec and Word Mover’s Distance), they measure the degrees of similarity between crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter. They analyze how this similarity pattern relates to a project’s funding performance and find that (1) the prior level of success of similar projects strongly predicts a new project’s funding performance, (2) the funding performance increases with a balance between being novel and imitative, (3) the optimal funding goal is close to the funds raised by prior similar projects, and (4) the funding performance increases with a balance between atypical and conventional imitation. The authors use these findings to generate actionable recommendations for project creators and crowdfunding platforms.
","We propose a novel method to study the effects of collaborative learning on the performance of collaborative projects. We propose that collaborative learning can increase the likelihood of a project’s success by increasing the likelihood that the project’s participants will collaborate with the project’s creators.

746,"Online, pure-labor service platforms (e.g., Zeel, Amazon Home Services, Freelancer.com) represent a multibillion-dollar market. An increasing managerial concern in such markets is the opportunistic behavior of service agents who defect with customers off platform for future transactions. Using multiple methods across studies, the authors explain this platform exploitation phenomenon. In Study 1, they utilize a theories-in-use approach to clarify why and when platform exploitation occurs and derive some hypotheses. Study 2 empirically tests these hypotheses using data from a health care platform that connects nurses and patients. The results indicate that high-quality, long-tenured service agents may enhance platform usage, but customers also are more likely to defect with such agents. Platform exploitation also increases with greater customer–agent interaction frequency (i.e., building stronger relationships). This phenomenon decreases agents’ platform usage due to capacity constraints caused by serving more customers off platform. These effects are stronger as service price increases (because higher prices equate to more fee savings), as service repetitiveness increases, and as the agent’s on-platform customer pool comprises more repeat and more proximal customers. Finally, the authors use two scenario-based experiments to establish some managerial strategies to combat platform exploitation.

747,"Industries use persuasion strategies to gain public support when challenged by activist groups on consumer-relevant issues. This marketing practice, termed “direct-to-public persuasion,” has received limited attention in the field, and thus we have little understanding of when such campaigns fail or succeed. This research introduces a theoretically derived and empirically supported framework that draws from multiple areas, including marketing persuasion, political campaign strategy, sociopolitical legitimacy, and perceptual fit, to identify important differences in the effectiveness of these persuasion strategies on attitudes and voting behavior. The multimethod approach includes a field study of ballot measure voting during a national U.S. election and three experimental studies. The findings contribute new knowledge of asymmetries in public response to industry and activist arguments. Stronger arguments from both sides lead to more favorable outcomes, but activist groups benefit most. Suspicion of activist arguments weakens the impact on attitudes and voting; industry argument suspicion has limited impact, though it does increase the likelihood of voter switching. A financial argumentation strategy works best for the industry side, while societal argumentation is more effective for the activist side. The insights offer guidance for industries and activist groups as argument strategy success is contingent on the side that uses it.

748,"Franchise encroachment, or the addition of an outlet in the vicinity of existing franchisees, is largely viewed as resulting in revenue cannibalization of incumbent locations. Against this backdrop, the authors consider the possibility that the addition of same brand outlets can, in fact, also create positive effects via customer utility and ultimately benefit franchisees, due to a range of mechanisms such as quality signaling, learning, or brand awareness, resulting in a positive pathway on franchisee performance. The authors unpack this possibility using an experiment and detailed proprietary and publicly available data sets from the hotel industry over a five-year period. Their results show evidence of positive effects on customer utility for same-brand outlets and stronger effects for newer brands, cross brands, and online travel agency channel bookings. Counterfactual simulations indicate that although encroachment hurts franchisees on average, it can modestly benefit same-brand franchisees in low-brand-density markets. Together, the findings illustrate the potential “sunny side” of encroachment, underscoring the need to update our view of encroachment as context-dependent. The novel emphasis on customers versus the dominant firm view suggests customer and incumbent responses to encroachment should be accounted for in the development of franchise strategy and public policy decisions.

749,"The authors investigate the role of the physical store in today’s multichannel environment. They posit that one benefit of the store to the retailer is to enhance customer value by providing the physical engagement needed to purchase deep products—products that require ample inspection for customers to make an informed decision. Using a multimethod approach involving a hidden Markov model of transaction data and two experiments, the authors find that buying deep products in the physical store transitions customers to the high-value state more than other product/channel combinations. Findings confirm the hypotheses derived from experiential learning theory. A moderated serial mediation test supports the experiential learning theory–based mechanism for translating physical engagement into customer value: Customers purchase a deep product from the physical store. They reflect on this physical engagement experience, and because it is tangible, concrete, and multisensory, it enables them to develop strong learning about the retailer. This experiential knowledge precipitates repatronage and generalizes to future online purchases in the same category and in adjacent categories, thus contributing to higher customer value. This research suggests that multichannel retailers use a combination of right-channel and right-product strategies for customer development and provides implications for experiential retail designs.

750,"This article studies how organizations should design a product by choosing the carbon footprint and price in a market with climate concerns. The authors develop a model and first show how the cost and demand effects of reducing the product carbon footprint determine the profit-maximizing product design. They find that stronger climate concerns reduce the product carbon footprint, demand, the overall corporate carbon footprint and profit, but have an ambiguous impact on price. Next, the authors establish that offsetting carbon emissions can create a win-win outcome for the firm and the climate if the cost of compensation is sufficiently low. Going net zero leads to a win for society if the cost of offsetting is sufficiently low compared to the social cost of pollution created by the corporate carbon footprint. Third, the authors show how regulation in the form of a cap-and-trade scheme or a carbon tax affects product design, firm profitability, and green technology adoption. Finally, the authors extend the analysis to a competitive scenario and show that going net zero creates a win-win-win outcome for the firm, the climate, and society if the offset technology is sufficiently effective.

751,"This article aims to broaden the understanding of quasi-experimental methods among marketing scholars and those who read their work by describing the underlying logic and set of actions that make their work convincing. The purpose of quasi-experimental methods is, in the absence of experimental variation, to determine the presence of a causal relationship. First, the authors explore how to identify settings and data where it is interesting to understand whether an action causally affects a marketing outcome. Second, they outline how to structure an empirical strategy to identify a causal empirical relationship. The article details the application of various methods to identify how an action affects an outcome in marketing, including difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, propensity score matching, synthetic control, and selection bias correction. The authors emphasize the importance of clearly communicating the identifying assumptions underlying the assertion of causality. Last, they explain how exploring the behavioral mechanism—whether individual, organizational, or market level—can actually reinforce arguments of causality.

752,"Most scientists claim that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in foods are safe for human consumption and offer societal benefits such as better nutritional content. However, many consumers remain skeptical about their safety. Against this backdrop of diverging views, the authors investigate the impact of different GMO labeling policy regimes on the products consumers choose. Guided by the literature on negativity bias, structural alignment theory, and message presentation, and based on findings from four experiments, the authors show that consumer demand for GM foods depends on the labeling regime policy makers adopt. Both absence-focused (“non-GMO”) and presence-focused (“contains GMO”) labeling regimes reduce the market share of GM foods, with the reduction being greater in the latter case. GMO labels reduce the importance consumers place on price and enhance their willingness to pay for non-GM products. Results indicate that specific label design choices policy makers implement (in the form of color and style) also affect consumer responses to GM labeling. Consumer attitudes toward GMOs moderate this effect—consumers with neutral attitudes toward GMOs are influenced most significantly by the label design.

753,"A core assumption across many disciplines is that producers enter market exchange relationships for economic reasons. This research examines an overlooked factor; namely, the socioemotional benefits of selling the fruits of one's labor. Specifically, the authors find that individuals selling their products interpret sales as a signal from the market that serves as a source of self-validation, thus increasing their happiness above and beyond any monetary rewards from those sales. This effect highlights an information asymmetry that is opposite to what is found in traditional signaling theory. That is, the authors find that customers have information about product quality that they signal to the producer, validating the producer's skill level. Furthermore, the sales-as-signal effect is moderated by characteristics of the purchase transaction that determine the signal strength of sales: The effect is attenuated when product choice does not reflect a deliberate decision and is amplified when buyers incur higher monetary costs. In addition, sales have a stronger effect on happiness than alternative, nonmonetary forms of market signals such as likes. Finally, the sales-as-signal effect is more pronounced when individuals sell their self-made (vs. other-made) products and affects individuals’ happiness beyond the happiness gained from producing.

754,"Platform markets involve indirect network effects as two or more sides of a market interact through an intermediary platform. Many platform markets consist of both a platform device and corresponding software. In such markets, new software introductions influence incumbent software sales, and new entrants may directly cannibalize incumbents. However, entrants may also create an indirect halo impact by attracting new platform adopters, who then purchase incumbent software. To measure performance holistically, this article introduces a method to quantify both indirect and direct paths and determine which effect dominates and when. The authors identify relevant moderators from the sensations–familiarity framework and conduct empirical tests with data from the video game industry (1995–2019). Results show that the direct impact often results in cannibalization, which generally increases when the entrant is a superstar or part of a franchise. For the indirect halo impact, superstar entrants significantly increase platform adoption, which can help all incumbents. Combining the direct and indirect impacts, the authors find that only new software that is both a superstar and part of a franchise increases platform adoption sufficiently to overcome direct cannibalization and achieve a net positive effect on incumbent software; all other types of entrants have a neutral or negative overall effect.

755,"Firms spend a substantial amount on lobbying—devoting financial resources on teams of lobbyists to further their interests among regulatory stakeholders. Previous research acknowledges that lobbying positively influences firm value, but no studies have examined the parallel effects for customers. Building on the attention-based view (ABV) of the firm, the authors examine these customer effects. Findings reveal that lobbying negatively affects customer satisfaction such that the positive relationship between lobbying and firm value is mediated by losses to customer satisfaction. These findings suggest a dark side of lobbying and challenge current thinking. However, several customer-focused moderators attenuate the negative effect of lobbying on customer satisfaction, predicted by ABV theory, including the chief executive officer’s background (marketing vs. other functional area) and the firm’s strategic use of resources (advertising spending, research-and-development spending, or lobbying for product market issues). These moderators ensure consistency between lobbying and customer priorities or direct firm attention toward customers even while firms continue to lobby. Finally, the authors verify that lobbying reduces the firm’s customer focus by measuring this focus directly using text analysis of firm communications with shareholders. Collectively, the research provides managerial implications for navigating both lobbying activities and customer priorities, and public policy implications for lobbying disclosure requirements.

756,"Social norms shape consumer behavior. However, it is not clear under what circumstances social norms are more versus less effective in doing so. This gap is addressed through an interdisciplinary meta-analysis examining the impact of social norms on consumer behavior across a wide array of contexts involving the purchase, consumption, use, and disposal of products and services, including socially approved (e.g., fruit consumption, donations) and disapproved (e.g., smoking, gambling) behaviors. Drawing from reactance theory and based on a cross-disciplinary data set of 250 effect sizes from research spanning 1978–2019 representing 112,478 respondents from 22 countries, the authors examine the effects of five categories of moderators of the effectiveness of social norms on consumer behavior: (1) target behavior characteristics, (2) communication factors, (3) consumer costs, (4) environmental factors, and (5) methodological characteristics. The findings suggest that while the effect of social norms on approved behavior is stable across time and cultures, their effect on disapproved behavior has grown over time and is stronger in survival and traditional cultures. Communications identifying specific organizations or close group members enhance compliance with social norms, as does the presence of monetary costs. The authors leverage their findings to offer managerial implications and a future research agenda for the field.

757,"Atmospheres are experiences of place involving transformations of consumers’ behaviors and emotions. Existing marketing research reveals how atmospheric stimuli, service performances, and ritual place-making enhance place experiences and create value for firms. Yet it remains unclear how shared experiences of atmosphere emerge and intensify among groups of people during collective live events. Accordingly, this article uses sociological interaction ritual theory to conceptualize “social atmospheres”: rapidly changing qualities of place created when a shared focus aligns consumers’ emotions and behavior, resulting in lively expressions of collective effervescence. With data from an ethnography of an English Premier League football stadium, the authors identify a four-stage process of creating atmospheres in interaction ritual chains. This framework goes beyond conventional retail and servicescape design by demonstrating that social atmospheres are mobile and cocreated between firms and consumers before, during, and after a main event. The study also reveals how interaction rituals can be disrupted and offers insight as to how firms can balance key tensions in creating social atmospheres as a means to enhance customer experiences, customer loyalty, and communal place attachments.
","The emergence of digital platforms has led to a renewed interest in the role of social media in the design of work environments. Drawing on the social media context, we examine how digital platforms can be used to enhance the social experience of workers in a work environment. Drawing on the social media context, we examine how workers’ social media use affects the design of work environments. We find that workers’ social media use affects the design of work environments by influencing the design of work environments by reinforcing the social experience of workers. We also find that workers’ social media use affects the design of work environments by reinforcing the social experience of workers. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of work environments and the design of work environments in the context of digital platforms. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of work environments and the design of work environments in the context of digital platforms.

758,"When allocating scarce goods and services, firms often either prioritize those willing to spend the most resources (e.g., money, in the case of markets; time, in the case of lines) or simply ignore such differences and allocate randomly (e.g., through lotteries). When do these resource-based allocation rules seem most appropriate, and why? Here, the authors propose that people are more likely to endorse markets and lines when these systems increase the likelihood that scarce goods and services go to those who have the strongest preferences—that is, when they help sort preferences. This is most feasible when preferences are dissimilar (i.e., some consumers want something much more than others). Consequently, people are naturally attuned to preference variance: when preferences for something are similar, markets and lines seem less appropriate, because it is unlikely that the highest bidders or those who have waited the longest actually have the strongest preferences. However, when preferences are dissimilar, markets and lines seem more appropriate, because they can more easily sort preferences. Consumers thus react negatively when firms use resource-based allocation rules in situations where preferences cannot be easily sorted (e.g., when preferences are similar).
",We study the optimal allocation of resources to firms that are not necessarily competitive. We consider two types of firms: firms that are not necessarily competitive and firms that are competitive. We consider firms that are competitive and firms that are competitive. We show that firms that are competitive are more likely to choose to allocate resources to firms that are not competitive. We also show that firms that are competitive are more likely to choose to allocate resources to firms that are not competitive. We also show that firms that are competitive are more likely to choose to allocate resources to firms that are not competitive. We also show that firms that are competitive are more likely to choose to allocate resources to firms that are not competitive. We also show that firms that are competitive are more likely to choose to allocate resources to firms that are not competitive. We also show that firms that are competitive are more likely to choose to allocate resources to firms that are not competitive.

759,"This investigation examines how consumer durable goods producers can leverage virtual reality for new product development. First, the authors develop a prelaunch sales forecasting approach with two key features: virtual reality and an extended macro-flow model. To assess its effectiveness, the authors collect data from 631 potential buyers of two real-world innovations. The results reveal that the new approach yields highly accurate prelaunch forecasts across the two field studies: compared with the actual sales data tracked after the product launches, the prediction errors for the aggregated first-year sales are only 1.9% (Study 1a, original prelaunch sales forecast), .0% (Study 1b, forecast with actual advertisement spending), and 20.0% (Study 1b, original prelaunch forecast). Moreover, the average mean absolute percentage error for the monthly sales is only 23% across both studies. Second, to understand the mechanisms of virtual reality, the authors conduct a controlled laboratory experiment. The findings reveal that virtual reality fosters behavioral consistency between participants’ information search, preferences, and buying behavior. Moreover, virtual reality enhances participants’ perceptions related to presence and vividness, but not their perceptions related to alternative theoretical perspectives. Finally, the authors provide recommendations for when and how managers can use virtual reality in new product development.

760,"Consumption can provide a feeling of groundedness or being emotionally rooted. This can occur when products connect consumers to their physical (place), social (people), and historic (past) environment. The authors introduce the concept of groundedness to the literature and show that it increases consumer choice; happiness; and feelings of safety, strength, and stability. Following these consequential outcomes, the authors demonstrate how marketers can provide consumers with a feeling of groundedness through product designs, distribution channels, and marketing communications. They also show how marketers might segment the market using observable proxies for consumers’ need for groundedness, such as high computer use, high socioeconomic status, or life changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Taken together, the findings show that groundedness is a powerful concept providing a comprehensive explanation for a variety of consumer trends, including the popularity of local, artisanal, and nostalgic products. It seems that in times of digitization, urbanization, and global challenges, the need to feel grounded has become particularly acute.

761,"The use of cobranding and brand extension strategies to access new markets has been a topic of significant interest. However, surprisingly few studies have examined cross-category connections of brands using publicly available digital footprints. In this study, the authors introduce a new, scalable automated approach for identifying potential cobranding and brand extension opportunities using brand networks derived from publicly available Twitter followership data. The digital user–brand relationship, established through followership activity, is regarded as an expression of interest toward the brand. Common followership patterns between brands are then extracted to capture cointerest between those brands’ audience. By utilizing the cointerest patterns, the approach aims to derive cross-category brand–brand and brand–category connections, which can serve as important measures for assessing cobranding and extensions opportunities. This article introduces a new construct, transcendence, which measures the extent to which a brand’s followers overlap with those of other brands in a new category. The analysis is conducted at different points in time to help managers track shifts in brand transcendence.

762,"With rapid technological developments, product-market boundaries have become more dynamic. Consequently, competition for products and services is emerging outside the product-market boundaries traditionally defined based on Standard Industrial Classification and North American Industry Classification System codes. Identifying these fluid product-market boundaries is critical for firms not only to compete effectively within a market but also to identify lurking threats and latent opportunities outside market boundaries. Newly available big data on social media engagement presents such an opportunity. The authors propose a deep network representation learning framework to capture latent relationships among thousands of brands and across many categories, using millions of social media users’ brand engagement data. They build a brand–user network and then compress the network into a lower-dimensional space using a deep autoencoder technique. The authors evaluate this approach quantitatively and qualitatively and visually display the market structure using the learned representations of brands. They validate the learned brand relationships using multiple external data sources. They also illustrate how this method can capture the dynamic changes of product-market boundaries using two well-known events—the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon and the introduction of the Model 3 by Tesla—and how managers can use the insights that emerge from this analysis.

763,"Consumers have grown increasingly skeptical of brands, leaving managers in a dire search for novel ways to connect. The authors suggest that focusing on one's relationships with competitors is a valuable, albeit unexpected, way for brands to do so. More specifically, the present research demonstrates that praising one's competitor—via “brand-to-brand praise”—often heightens preference for the praiser more so than other common forms of communication, such as self-promotion or benevolent information. This is because brand-to-brand praise increases perceptions of brand warmth, which leads to enhanced brand evaluations and choice. The authors support this theory with seven studies conducted in the lab, online, and in the field that feature multiple managerially relevant outcomes, including brand attitudes, social media and advertising engagement, brand choice, and purchase behavior, in a variety of product and service contexts. The authors also identify key boundary conditions and rule out alternative explanations, further elucidating the underlying mechanism and important implementation insights. This work contributes to the understanding of brand perception and warmth, providing a novel way for brands to connect to consumers by connecting with each other.

764,"Many firms use market share to set marketing goals and monitor performance. Recent meta-analytic research reveals the average economic impact of market share performance and identifies some factors affecting its value. However, empirical understanding of why any market share–profit relationship exists and varies is limited. The authors simultaneously examine the three primary theoretical mechanisms linking firm market share with profit. On average, they find that most of the variance in market share’s positive effect on firm profit is explained by market power and quality signaling, with little support for operating efficiency as a mechanism. They find a similar explanatory role of the three mechanisms in conditions where market share negatively predicts profit (for niche firms and those “buying” market share). Using these mechanism insights, the authors show that the value of market share differs in predictable ways between firms and across industries, providing new understanding of when managers may usefully set market share goals. The authors also provide new insights into how market share should be measured for goal setting and performance monitoring. They show that revenue market share is a predictor of firm profit while unit market share is not, and that relative measures of revenue market share can provide greater predictive power.

765,"Economic conditions may significantly affect households’ shopping behavior and, by extension, retailers’ and manufacturers’ firm performance. By explicitly distinguishing between two basic types of economic conditions—micro conditions, in terms of households’ personal income, and macro conditions, in terms of the business cycle—this study analyzes how households adjust their grocery shopping behavior. The authors observe more than 5,000 households over eight years and analyze shopping outcomes in terms of what, where, and how much they shop and spend. Results show that micro and macro conditions substantially influence shopping outcomes, but in very different ways. Microeconomic changes lead households to adjust primarily their overall purchase volume—that is, after losing income, households buy fewer products and spend less in total. In contrast, macroeconomic changes cause pronounced structural shifts in households’ shopping basket allocation and spending behavior. Specifically, during contractions, households shift purchases toward private labels while also buying and consequently spending more than during expansions. During expansions, however, households increasingly purchase national brands but keep their total spending constant. The authors discuss psychological and sociological mechanisms that can explain the differential effects of micro and macro conditions on shopping behavior and develop important diagnostic and normative implications for retailers and manufacturers.

766,"The authors investigate how the geographical distance between online users is associated with electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) effectiveness. Their research leverages variation in the visibility of eWOM messages on the social media platform of Twitter to address the issue of correlated user behaviors and preferences. The study shows that the likelihood that followers who are exposed to users’ WOM subsequently make purchases increases with followers’ geographic proximity to the users. The authors propose social identification as a potential mechanism for why geographical distance still matters online in eWOM: because consumers may form a sense of social identity based on their physical location, information regarding the spatial proximity of users could trigger online social identification with others. The findings are robust to alternative methods and specifications, such as further controlling for latent user homophily by incorporating user characteristics and embeddings based on advanced machine-learning and deep-learning models and a corpus of 140 million messages. The authors also rule out several alternative explanations. The findings have important implications for platform design, content curation, and seeding and targeting strategies.

767,"The proliferating gig economy relies on online freelance marketplaces, which support relatively anonymous interactions through text-based messages. Informational asymmetries thus arise that can lead to exchange uncertainties between buyers and freelancers. Conventional marketing thought recommends reducing such uncertainty. However, uncertainty reduction and uncertainty management theories indicate that buyers and freelancers might benefit more from balancing—rather than reducing—uncertainty, such as by strategically adhering to or deviating from common communication principles. With dyadic analyses of calls for bids and bids from a leading online freelance marketplace, this study reveals that buyers attract more bids from freelancers when they provide moderate degrees of task information and concreteness, avoid sharing personal information, and limit the affective intensity of their communication. Freelancers’ bid success and price premiums increase when they mimic the degree of task information and affective intensity exhibited by buyers. However, mimicking a lack of personal information and concreteness reduces freelancers’ success, so freelancers should always be more concrete and offer more personal information than buyers. These contingent perspectives offer insights into buyer–seller communication in two-sided online marketplaces. They clarify that despite, or sometimes due to, communication uncertainty, both sides can achieve success in the online gig economy.

768,"Marketing scholars increasingly use web scraping and application programming interfaces (APIs) to collect data from the internet. Yet, despite the widespread use of such web data, the idiosyncratic and sometimes insidious challenges in its collection have received limited attention. How can researchers ensure that the data sets generated via web scraping and APIs are valid? While existing resources emphasize technical details of extracting web data, the authors propose a novel methodological framework focused on enhancing its validity. In particular, the framework highlights how addressing validity concerns requires the joint consideration of idiosyncratic technical and legal/ethical questions along the three stages of collecting web data: selecting data sources, designing the data collection, and extracting the data. The authors further review more than 300 articles using web data published in the top five marketing journals and offer a typology of how web data have advanced marketing thought. The article concludes with directions for future research to identify promising web data sources and embrace novel approaches for using web data to capture and describe evolving marketplace realities.

769,"This research analyzes the cultural contradictions of authenticity as they pertain to the actions of consumers and marketers. The authors’ conceptualization diverges from the conventional assumption that the ambiguity manifest in the concept of authenticity can be resolved by identifying an essential set of defining attributes or by conceptualizing it as a continuum. Using a semiotic approach, the authors identify a general system of structural relationships and ambiguous classifications that organize the meanings through which authenticity is understood and contested in a given market context. They demonstrate the contextually adaptable nature of this framework by analyzing the authenticity contradictions generated by the cultural tensions between “conscious capitalism”—a market logic that encompasses both global brands and small independent businesses, such as a farm-to-table restaurant or an organic food co-op—and the elitist critique. The Slow Food movement provides a case study for analyzing how consumers, producers, and entrepreneurs who identify with conscious capitalist ideals understand these disauthenticating, elitist associations and the strategies they use to counter them. The authors conclude by discussing implications of the analysis for theories of authenticity and for managing the authenticity challenges facing conscious capitalist brands.

770,"Despite the ubiquity of pets in consumers’ lives, scant research has examined how exposure to them (e.g., recalling past interactions with dogs and cats, viewing ads featuring a dog or a cat) influences consumer behavior. The authors demonstrate that exposure to dogs (cats) reminds consumers of the stereotypical temperaments and behaviors of the pet species, which activates a promotion- (prevention-) focused motivational mindset among consumers. Using secondary data, Study 1 shows that people in states with a higher percentage of dog (cat) owners Google more promotion- (prevention-) focused words and report a higher COVID-19 transmission rate. Using multiple products, Studies 2 and 3 demonstrate that these regulatory mindsets, when activated by pet exposure, carry over to influence downstream consumer judgments, purchase intentions, and behaviors, even in pet-unrelated consumption contexts. Study 4 shows that pet stereotypicality moderates the proposed effect such that the relationship between pet exposure and regulatory orientations persists to the extent consumers are reminded of the stereotypical temperaments and behaviors of the pet species. Studies 5–7 examine the role of regulatory fit and evince that exposure to dogs (cats) leads to more favorable responses toward advertising messages featuring promotion- (prevention-) focused appeals.

771,"Firms increasingly follow an “always on” philosophy, publishing multiple pieces of firm-generated content (FGC) every day. Current methodologies used in marketing are unfit to unbiasedly capture the impact of FGC disseminated intermittently throughout the day on stock markets characterized by ultra-high-frequency trading. They also neither distinguish between the permanent (i.e., long-term) and temporary (i.e., short-term) price impacts nor identify FGC attributes capable of generating these price impacts. In this study, the authors define price impact as the impact on the variance of stock price. Employing a market microstructure approach to exploit the variance of high-frequency changes in stock price, the authors estimate the permanent and temporary price impacts of the firm-generated Twitter content of S&P 500 information technology firms. The authors find that firm-generated tweets induce both permanent and temporary price impacts, which are linked to tweet attributes of valence and subject matter. Tweets reflecting only valence or subject matter concerning consumer or competitor orientation result in temporary price impacts, whereas those embodying both attributes generate permanent price impacts. Negative-valence tweets about competitors generate the largest permanent price impacts. Building on these findings, the authors offer suggestions to marketing managers regarding the design of intraday FGC.

772,"Charities are constantly looking for new and more effective ways to engage potential donors in order to secure the resources needed to deliver services. The current work demonstrates that creative activities are one way for marketers to meet this challenge. Field and lab studies find that engaging potential donors in creative activities positively influences their donation behaviors (i.e., the likelihood of donation and the monetary amount donated). Importantly, the observed effects are shown to be context independent: they hold even when potential donors engage in creative activities unrelated to the focal cause of the charity (or the charitable organization itself). The findings suggest that engaging in a creative activity enhances the felt autonomy of the participant, thus inducing a positive affective state, which in turn leads to higher donation behaviors. Positive affect is demonstrated to enhance donation behaviors due to perceptions of donation impact and a desire for mood maintenance. However, the identified effects emerge only when one engages in a creative activity—not when the activity is noncreative, or when only the concept of creativity itself is made salient.

773,"Contrary to the intuition that salespeople gravitate toward big-whale sales opportunities, in reality they often avoid them. To study this phenomenon, the authors integrate contingent decision-making and conservation-of-resources theories to develop and test a framework of salespeople's decision making when prospecting. Study 1 reveals that the performance impact of salesperson initial judgment of opportunity magnitude follows an inverted U-shape, indicating that salespeople's avoidance of large opportunities results from rational benefit–cost analyses due to their conservation of resources. Interestingly, salespeople use a calibration decision-making strategy (i.e., calculating expected benefits by accounting for conversion uncertainty) at the portfolio rather than prospect level, in solution- but not product-selling contexts. Ignoring this calibration effect can lead to under- or overestimation of conversion rates of up to 100%. Study 2 shows that salespeople's past performance success and experience bias this calibration. Simulations reveal that when high performers or inexperienced salespeople believe their portfolio magnitude is large and conversion uncertainty low, they are less concerned about resource conservation and improve their quota attainment by 50%. Study 3 confirms the theoretical mechanism. These findings shed new light on salespeople's decision making and suggest ways for sales professionals to improve effectiveness when prospecting.

774,"Crowdfunding has emerged as a mechanism to raise funds for entrepreneurial ideas. On crowdfunding platforms, backers (i.e., individuals who fund ideas) jointly fund the same idea, leading to affiliations, or overlaps, within the community. The authors find that while an increase in the total number of backers may positively affect funding behavior, the resulting affiliations affect funding negatively. They reason that when affiliated others fund a new idea, individuals may feel less of a need to fund, a process known as “vicarious moral licensing.” Drawing on data collected from 2,021 ideas on a prominent crowdfunding platform, the authors show that prior affiliation among backers negatively affects an idea’s funding amount and eventual funding success. Creator engagement (i.e., idea description and updates) and backer engagement (i.e., Facebook shares) moderate this negative effect. The effect of affiliation is robust across several instrumental variables, model specifications, measures of affiliation, and multiple crowdfunding outcomes. Results from three experiments, a survey, and interviews with backers support the negative effect of affiliation and show that it can be explained by vicarious moral licensing. The authors develop actionable insights for creators to mitigate the negative effects of affiliation with the language used in idea descriptions and updates.

775,"The unprecedented number of product recalls in recent years and subsequent low consumer recall compliance raise questions about the role of regulatory agencies in ensuring safety. In this study, the authors develop a conceptual framework to test the impact of a regulator-initiated digital marketing campaign (DMC) on consumer recall compliance. The empirical context is the launch of a nationwide DMC by the U.S. automobile industry’s regulator. The analysis utilizes recall completion data from 296 product recalls active both before and after the DMC’s launch. The results show that the DMC improves consumer recall compliance. In the first four quarters after it was introduced, the DMC increased the number of vehicles fixed, on average, by 20,712 per recall campaign over what would be expected without the DMC. Regarding boundary conditions, the study finds that the DMC is more effective for recall campaigns with greater media coverage and for those with older recalled products. However, the DMC’s effect weakens as the time needed to repair a defective component increases. The findings should help regulators make compelling cases for greater resource allocation toward digital initiatives to improve recall compliance.

776,"The effective training of salespeople is crucial to a firm's success; there is arguably no more critical type of training than a salesperson's onboarding. In this study, the authors leverage a natural field experiment in which a firm's newly hired salespeople can undergo onboarding through either a decentralized program or a centralized program to examine the relative impact of each program. Drawing on organizational socialization theory, the authors consider whether an onboarding program that incorporates both individualized and institutionalized socialization tactics (the decentralized program) can develop salespeople into higher performers by encouraging them to take a more innovative and adaptive approach to different facets of the sales role. The findings reveal that salespeople who underwent the decentralized program achieved approximately 23.5% higher sales performance than those who underwent the centralized program. The performance benefits of the decentralized program were amplified for salespeople whose managers had a narrower span of control. In addition, these performance benefits were appreciable for those salespeople transitioning from another job but negligible for those transitioning from school. A scenario-based experiment enriches the field experiment's findings by showing evidence of the theorized mechanism underlying the sales performance benefits observed: the fostering of an innovative role orientation.

777,"The authors draw on the sociological theories of the “liability of newness” and the “liability of adolescence” to generate new insights into relationship evolution. First, they show how a new relationship in its “honeymoon” phase exhibits a unique constellation of two conditions, namely information asymmetry and forbearance. Next, they explain how a relationship evolves along two processes that involve passive learning and decay, respectively. In themselves, these processes will move a relationship toward a long-term “transactional” state and possibly termination, but the processes can also be actively shaped using various governance mechanisms. Doing so, however, requires a nuanced account of types of governance mechanisms and the particular conditions they are intended to induce. The authors consider how the general mechanisms of (1) incentives and (2) information sharing can be deployed in standardized or customized fashions, respectively. Next, they suggest how different manifestation of governance mechanisms impact a relationship's underlying evolutionary processes and evolved relationship states. In general, their framework represents a new perspective on relationship evolution—one that involves the purposeful management of initial conditions and their related evolutionary processes.

778,"How markets evolve is a perennial and important question in business. Building on a large qualitative data set on the coffee market comprising primary and secondary interviews, archival data, and fieldwork, the authors introduce a novel theoretical mechanism—practice expansion—to explain how ongoing institutional complexity fosters market evolution. To theorize practice expansion, the authors combine institutional logics with resource partitioning and introduce a two-by-two typology of firms evolving in markets: craft versus commercial and generalist versus specialist. The authors’ analysis, grounded in this typology, identifies three mechanisms that explain practice expansion (elaboration, translation, and transformation). The authors then show how practice expansion contributes to market evolution by increasing product diversity, broadening skills and knowledge, and enriching the market meaning system. The novel theory introduced in this article contributes to extant work by theorizing market evolution as resulting from practice expansion and by broadening our understanding of the types of firms and their interactions important to that evolution. The novel theory also points to important strategy implications for how different types of firms can contribute to and benefit from the identified evolutionary patterns and ongoing institutional complexity.

779,"Conventional wisdom in marketing emphasizes the detrimental effects of negative online reviews for brands. An important question is whether some firms could more effectively manage negative reviews to increase brand preference and improve outcomes. To address the question, this research examines how customers respond to online reviews of identity-relevant brands in particular, which have been overlooked in the online reviews literature. Eight studies (field data and experiments featuring consequential and hypothetical behaviors) show that negative online reviews may not be so detrimental for identity-relevant brands, especially when those reviews originate from socially distant (vs. socially close) reviewers. This occurs because a negative review of an identity-relevant brand can pose a threat to a customer's identity, prompting the customer to strengthen their relationship with the identity-relevant brand. To document the underlying process, the authors show that this effect does not emerge when the review is positive or the brand is identity-irrelevant. Importantly, the authors identify circumstances when negative reviews can actually produce positive outcomes (higher preference) for identity-relevant brands over no reviews or even positive reviews. By demonstrating the upside of negative reviews for identity-relevant brands, the findings have important implications for marketing theory and practice.

780,"Influencer marketing initiatives require firms to select and incentivize online influencers to engage their followers on social media in an attempt to promote the firms’ offerings. However, limited research considers the costs of influencer marketing when evaluating these campaigns’ effectiveness, particularly from an engagement elasticity perspective. Moreover, it is unclear whether and how marketers could enhance influencer marketing effectiveness by strategically selecting influencers, targeting their followers, or managing content. This study draws on a communication model to examine how factors related to the sender of a message (influencer), the receiver of the message (influencer's followers), and the message itself (influencer's posts) determine influencer marketing effectiveness. The findings show that influencer originality, follower size, and sponsor salience enhance effectiveness, and posts that announce new product launches diminish it. Several tensions arise when firms select influencers and manage content: Influencer activity, follower–brand fit, and post positivity all exert inverted U-shaped moderating effects on influencer marketing effectiveness, suggesting that firms that adopt a balanced approach along these dimensions can achieve greater effectiveness. These novel insights offer important implications for marketers designing influencer marketing campaigns.

781,"This article examines the effect of political identity on customers’ satisfaction with the products and services they consume. Recent work suggests that conservatives are less likely to complain than liberals. Building on that work, the present research examines how political identity shapes customer satisfaction, which has broad implications for customers and firms. Nine studies combine different methodologies, primary and secondary data, real and hypothetical behavior, different product categories, and diverse participant populations to show that conservatives (vs. liberals) are more satisfied with the products and services they consume. This happens because conservatives (vs. liberals) are more likely to believe in free will (i.e., that people have agency over their decisions) and, therefore, to trust their own decisions. The authors document the broad and tangible downstream consequences of this effect for customers’ repurchase and recommendation intentions and firms’ sales. The association of political identity and customer satisfaction is attenuated when belief in free will is externally weakened, choice is limited, or the consumption experience is overwhelmingly positive.

782,"This research demonstrates that the physical properties of shopping carts influence purchasing and spending. Prior research on ergonomics indicates that standard shopping carts, which are pushed via a horizontal handlebar, are likely to activate arm extensor muscles. Prior research on arm muscle activation, in turn, suggests that arm extensor activation may elicit less purchasing than arm flexor activation. The authors thus deduce that standard shopping carts may be suboptimal for stimulating purchases. The authors predicted that shopping carts with parallel handles (such as on a wheelbarrow or “walker”) would instead activate the flexor muscles and thus increase purchasing. An electromyography study revealed that both horizontal and vertical handles more strongly activate the extensor muscles of the upper arm (triceps), whereas parallel handles more strongly activate the flexor muscles (biceps). In a field experiment, parallel-handle shopping carts significantly and substantially increased sales across a broad range of categories, including both vice and virtue products. Finally, in a simulated shopping experiment, parallel handles increased purchasing and spending beyond both horizontal and vertical handles. These results were not attributable to the novelty of the shopping cart itself, participants’ mood, or purely ergonomic factors.

783,"Sales, product design, and engineering teams benefit immensely from better understanding customer perspectives. How do customers combine a product's technical specifications (i.e., engineered attributes) to form abstract product benefits (i.e., meta-attributes)? To address this question, the authors use machine learning and natural language processing to develop a methodological framework that extracts a hierarchy of product attributes based on contextual information of how attributes are expressed in consumer reviews. The attribute hierarchy reveals linkages between engineered attributes and meta-attributes within a product category, enabling flexible sentiment analysis that can identify how consumers receive meta-attributes, and which engineered attributes are main drivers. The framework can guide managers to monitor only portions of review content that are relevant to specific attributes of interest. Moreover, managers can compare products within and between brands, where different names and attribute combinations are often associated with similar benefits. The authors apply the framework to the tablet computer category to generate dashboards and perceptual maps and provide validations of the attribute hierarchy using both primary and secondary data. Resultant insights allow the exploration of substantive questions, such as how Apple improved successive generations of iPads and why Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba discontinued their tablet product lines.

784,"The present research demonstrates how consumer responses to negative and positive offers are influenced by whether the administering marketing agent is an artificial intelligence (AI) or a human. In the case of a product or service offer that is worse than expected, consumers respond better when dealing with an AI agent in the form of increased purchase likelihood and satisfaction. In contrast, for an offer that is better than expected, consumers respond more positively to a human agent. The authors demonstrate that AI agents, compared with human agents, are perceived to have weaker intentions when administering offers, which accounts for this effect. That is, consumers infer that AI agents lack selfish intentions in the case of an offer that favors the agent and lack benevolent intentions in the case of an offer that favors the customer, thereby dampening the extremity of consumer responses. Moreover, the authors demonstrate a moderating effect, such that marketers may anthropomorphize AI agents to strengthen perceived intentions, providing an avenue to receive due credit from consumers when the agent provides a better offer and mitigate blame when it provides a worse offer. Potential ethical concerns with the use of AI to bypass consumer resistance to negative offers are discussed.

785,"This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the impact of advertising creative strategy (ACS) on advertising elasticity, founded on an integrative framework that distinguishes between the function (content) and form (execution) of an advertising creative. The authors evaluate function using a three-dimensional representation of content (experience, affect, cognition), whereas the representation of form accounts for both executional elements and the use of creative templates. The distinction between function and form allows for the investigation of potential synergies between content and execution, previously unaccounted for in the literature. The ACS framework also facilitates the calculation of composite metrics that capture holistic aspects of the creative strategy, such as focus (i.e., the extent of the emphasis on a specific content dimension) and variation (i.e., changes in content and execution over time). The empirical application focuses on a dynamic linear model analysis of 2,251 television advertising creatives from 91 brands in 16 consumer packaged goods categories. The findings show that for function, experiential content has the greatest effect on elasticity, followed by cognitive and affective content. Function and form produce synergies that advertisers can leverage to increase returns. Finally, focus, variation, and the use of templates increase advertising elasticity.

786,"The authors draw on emerging research in organization theory to suggest how different firm-level identity orientations (individualistic, relational, or collectivistic) impact governance choice. They develop a conceptual framework that focuses on the relationship between a focal firm’s own identity orientation and that of a value chain partner. The framework identifies a series of match and mismatch scenarios, where the latter represent unique governance problems that are not accounted for by existing theory. Some of the mismatch scenarios involve pseudo-matches that resemble convergent orientations between parties but actually represent governance problems. Theoretically, this framework advances the governance literature by providing a comprehensive and nuanced account of (1) the orientations that parties bring to bear on a relationship, and (2) how their effects vary depending on the interdependence structure between the parties. The authors also advance the general literature on identity orientation by connecting it to concrete governance practices, by showing how multiple internal identity orientations create unique internal governance challenges, and by delineating two possible solutions to these challenges. They rely on the framework to develop managerial guidelines for governance choice.

787,"People hold strong moral objections to commercial bodily markets—the buying and selling of the human body and its components (e.g., prostitution; commercial surrogacy; trade of kidneys, blood plasma, sperm, ovum, and hair). This research takes a descriptive approach to understand why people object to the marketing of the human body and how their moral objections differ across the political spectrum. The authors propose that liberals and conservatives find bodily markets to be morally wrong; however, the two groups object to bodily markets for different reasons. Liberals are more sensitive to exploitation concerns, but conservatives are more sensitive to violation of sanctity concerns in these markets. Real-world observational data and controlled experiments test these predictions. The findings show how sociopolitical leaders utilize the different moral objections to persuade their respective audiences, such as how conservative versus more liberal pastors sermonize differently on prostitution. Second, results show how targeted marketing campaigns encourage liberals and conservatives to participate in consumer advocacy and donate to political causes. Third, findings outline how liberals and conservatives support different regulatory laws that penalize buyers versus sellers. Finally, results show how the different moral objections manifest for live bodily products but not for dead bodily products.

788,"As customer ratings have become ubiquitous and digital platforms can directly request ratings and tips from customers, it is important to understand how a customer rating influences tipping. The authors investigate whether, how, why, and when the order of rating and tipping affects both consumer behaviors in seven studies, including one quasi-field experiment, one archival data analysis, one randomized field experiment, and four randomized lab experiments. They show that asking customers to rate a service professional before tipping negatively impacts the tip amount but that tipping first does not affect subsequent rating scores. The authors propose that the negative effect of rating on tipping occurs because, when rating a service professional first, customers categorize their feedback as a reward for the service professional, which partially alleviates the felt obligation to tip, resulting in a smaller tip. This negative effect is more evident when customers (1) tip from their own pocket, (2) have higher categorization flexibility, or (3) perceive that the service professional benefits from the rating. Moreover, highlighting the consistency motivation after rating but before tipping can attenuate this effect. These boundary conditions not only support the proposed mechanism and evaluate alternative processes but also have significant practical implications.

789,"Premium organic retailers are specialist retailers that exclusively offer organic products. Prior literature has not studied their entry, focusing instead on the impact of generalist store entry. This study examines the impact of premium organic specialist store entry on category performance at incumbent generalist stores for 47 packaged food and beverage categories. The results indicate that incumbent stores lose sales after a local organic store entry and that the impact of price on sales at generalist stores becomes stronger. The authors postulate that incumbent stores can reduce sales losses by reducing the relative distinctiveness of the entrant along three dimensions: variety, price–quality, and authenticity. Empirical results show that more variety in organic products, as well as more organic feature and display advertising, protect generalist stores from premium organic specialist store entry. Assortments composed of premium organic products are harmed less, whereas assortments in which organic products are subject to more frequent and deeper price promotions are harmed more. Furthermore, including products from an organic specialist brand in generalists’ organic assortments offers additional protection.

790,"Low-fit brand extensions, while often presenting profitable opportunities for existing brands, are known to meet with varying levels of consumer acceptance. This research identifies conditions in which low-fit extensions can succeed. Specifically, the authors show that the extent to which consumers consider the context in forming judgments (i.e., they are context dependent) determines their acceptance of low-fit extensions. Across four studies, the authors examine the combined effects of context (in)dependence and type of information. Context-dependent consumers form their evaluations on the basis of the type of brand extension information provided, such that providing benefit-based information enhances the evaluations of low-fit extensions, whereas providing attribute-based information leads to a reliance on extension fit and subsequent unfavorable evaluations of low fit extensions. In contrast, context-independent consumers are more likely to base their judgments on extension fit regardless of whether they receive attribute- or benefit-based information. Acceptance of high-fit extensions is unaffected by context (in)dependence and type of information. These findings provide a two-step strategy (i.e., sensitize consumers to context and providing benefit-based extension information) to managers for launching low-fit extensions and leveraging existing parent brand equity.
","We examine the impact of customer-specific information on the value of a product and its value-added value (VAR) through a longitudinal study of a large-scale, multilevel, multilevel, and multidimensional multilevel multilevel product market. We find that customer-specific information positively affects the value of a product and its value-added value (VAR) by approximately 2.5%–3.5% and by approximately 2.5%–3.5% for a variety of product categories, including health, beauty, and fitness. The positive effect of customer-specific information on VAR is stronger for products with higher product-specific value, such as fitness products, which are more likely to be marketed as fitness products. The positive effect of customer-specific information on VAR is stronger for products with higher product-specific value, such as fitness products, which are more likely to be marketed as fitness products. We find that the positive effect of customer-specific information on VAR is stronger for products with higher product-specific value, such as fitness products, which are more likely to be marketed as fitness products.

791,"The question of how to improve the effectiveness of charitable solicitation has long been a subject of investigation for charity organizations. Through six studies, including four incentive-compatible studies and a field study, the present research demonstrates an easy, actionable, and widely applicable semantic-framing strategy that can be utilized to promote charitable giving. Semantically framing charitable giving as a gift (rather than a donation) increases not only donors’ intention to contribute but also their actual contribution amount (Studies 1–3). Both mediation (Study 4) and moderation (Study 5) approaches provide convergent evidence that the effect of framing charitable giving as a gift rather than a donation on contribution is driven by donors’ perceived social distance from beneficiaries. The authors further find that this framing effect is weakened when soliciting contributions from donors who see social distance as desirable (e.g., those with a high need for status; Study 6). The current work contributes to the literature streams on charitable giving, social exchange, and semantic framing and provides strong managerial implications for charity organizations.

792,"We present a heavy traffic analysis for a single server queue with renewal arrivals and generally distributed i.i.d. service times, in which the server employs the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) policy. Under typical heavy traffic assumptions, we prove a diffusion limit theorem for a measure-valued state descriptor, from which we conclude a similar theorem for the queue length process. These results allow us to make some observations on the queue length optimality of SRPT. In particular, they provide the sharpest illustration of the well-known tension between queue length optimality and quality of service for this policy.

793,"In this paper we consider iterative methods for stochastic variational inequalities (s.v.i.) with monotone operators. Our basic assumption is that the operator possesses both smooth and nonsmooth components. Further, only noisy observations of the problem data are available. We develop a novel Stochastic Mirror-Prox (SMP) algorithm for solving s.v.i. and show that with the convenient stepsize strategy it attains the optimal rates of convergence with respect to the problem parameters. We apply the SMP algorithm to Stochastic composite minimization and describe particular applications to Stochastic Semidefinite Feasibility problem and deterministic Eigenvalue minimization.

794,"We study an ordinary differential equation (ODE) arising as the many-server heavy-traffic fluid limit of a sequence of overloaded Markovian queueing models with two customer classes and two service pools. The system, known as the X model in the call-center literature, operates under the fixed-queue-ratio-with-thresholds (FQR-T) control, which we proposed in a recent paper as a way for one service system to help another in face of an unanticipated overload. Each pool serves only its own class until a threshold is exceeded; then one-way sharing is activated with all customer-server assignments then driving the two queues toward a fixed ratio. For large systems, that fixed ratio is achieved approximately. The ODE describes system performance during an overload. The control is driven by a queue-difference stochastic process, which operates in a faster time scale than the queueing processes themselves, thus achieving a time-dependent steady state instantaneously in the limit. As a result, for the ODE, the driving process is replaced by its long-run average behavior at each instant of time; i.e., the ODE involves a heavy-traffic averaging principle (AP).

795,"We analyze the error between a discretely rebalanced portfolio and its continuously rebalanced counterpart in the presence of jumps or mean-reversion in the underlying asset dynamics. With discrete rebalancing, the portfolio’s composition is restored to a set of fixed target weights at discrete intervals; with continuous rebalancing, the target weights are maintained at all times. We examine the difference between the two portfolios as the number of discrete rebalancing dates increases. With either mean reversion or jumps, we derive the limiting variance of the relative error between the two portfolios. With mean reversion and no jumps, we show that the scaled limiting error is asymptotically normal and independent of the level of the continuously rebalanced portfolio. With jumps, the scaled relative error converges in distribution to the sum of a normal random variable and a compound Poisson random variable. For both the mean-reverting and jump-diffusion cases, we derive “volatility adjustments” to improve the approximation of the discretely rebalanced portfolio by the continuously rebalanced portfolio, based on on the limiting covariance between the relative rebalancing error and the level of the continuously rebalanced portfolio. These results are based on strong approximation results for jump-diffusion processes.

796,"We consider a two-dimensional semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) in the nonnegative quadrant. The data of the SRBM consists of a two-dimensional drift vector, a 2 × 2 positive definite covariance matrix, and a 2 × 2 reflection matrix. Assuming the SRBM is positive recurrent, we are interested in tail asymptotic of its marginal stationary distribution along each direction in the quadrant. For a given direction, the marginal tail distribution has the exact asymptotic of the form bxκ exp(−αx) as x goes to infinity, where α and b are positive constants and κ takes one of the values −3/2, −1/2, 0, or 1; both the decay rate α and the power κ can be computed explicitly from the given direction and the SRBM data.A key tool in our proof is a relationship governing the moment generating function of the two-dimensional stationary distribution and two moment generating functions of the associated one-dimensional boundary measures. This relationship allows us to characterize the convergence domain of the two-dimensional moment generating function. For a given direction c, the line in this direction intersects the boundary of the convergence domain at one point, and that point uniquely determines the decay rate α. The one-dimensional moment generating function of the marginal distribution along direction c has a singularity at α. Using analytic extension in complex analysis, we characterize the precise nature of the singularity there. Using that characterization and complex inversion techniques, we obtain the exact asymptotic of the marginal tail distribution.

797,"Various empirical and theoretical studies indicate that cumulative network traffic is a Gaussian process. However, depending on whether the intensity at which sessions are initiated is large or small relative to the session duration tail, [25] and [15] have shown that traffic at large time scales can be approximated by either fractional Brownian motion (fBm) or stable Lévy motion. We study distributional properties of cumulative traffic that consists of a finite number of independent streams and give an explanation of why Gaussian examples abound in practice but not stable Lévy motion. We offer an explanation of how much vertical aggregation is needed for the Gaussian approximation to hold. Our results are expressed as limit theorems for a sequence of cumulative traffic processes whose session initiation intensities satisfy growth rates similar to those used in [25].

798,"Typical protocols for peer-to-peer file sharing over the Internet divide files to be shared into pieces. New peers strive to obtain a complete collection of pieces from other peers and from a seed. In this paper we investigate a problem that can occur if the seeding rate is not large enough. The problem is that, even if the statistics of the system are symmetric in the pieces, there can be symmetry breaking, with one piece becoming very rare. If peers depart after obtaining a complete collection, they can tend to leave before helping other peers receive the rare piece. Assuming that peers arrive with no pieces, there is a single seed, random peer contacts are made, random useful pieces are downloaded, and peers depart upon receiving the complete file, the system is stable if the seeding rate (in pieces per time unit) is greater than the arrival rate, and is unstable if the seeding rate is less than the arrival rate. The result persists for any piece selection policy that selects from among useful pieces, such as rarest first, and it persists with the use of network coding.

799,"We derive a stochastic gradient algorithm for semidefinite optimization using randomization techniques. The algorithm uses subsampling to reduce the computational cost of each iteration and the subsampling ratio explicitly controls granularity, i.e. the tradeoff between cost per iteration and total number of iterations. Furthermore, the total computational cost is directly proportional to the complexity (i.e. rank) of the solution. We study numerical performance on some large-scale problems arising in statistical learning.

800,"We consider a standard splitting algorithm for the rare-event simulation of overflow probabilities in any subset of stations in a Jackson network at level n, starting at a fixed initial position. It was shown in [8] that a subsolution to the Isaacs equation guarantees that a subexponential number of function evaluations (in n) suffices to estimate such overflow probabilities within a given relative accuracy. Our analysis here shows that in fact O(n2βV + 1) function evaluations suffice to achieve a given relative precision, where βV is the number of bottleneck stations in the subset of stations under consideration in the network. This is the first rigorous analysis that favorably compares splitting against directly computing the overflow probability of interest, which can be evaluated by solving a linear system of equations with O(nd) variables.

801,"Under general conditions, the number of customers in a GI/D/s + GI many-server queue at time t converges to a unique stationary distribution as t → ∞. However, simulations show that the sample paths routinely exhibit nearly periodic behavior over long time intervals when the system is overloaded and s is large, provided that the system does not start in steady state. Moreover, the precise periodic behavior observed depends critically on the initial conditions. We provide insight into the transient behavior by studying the deterministic fluid model, which arises as the many-server heavy-traffic limit. The limiting fluid model also has a unique stationary point, but that stationary point is not approached from any other initial state as t → ∞. Instead, the fluid model performance approaches one of its uncountably many periodic steady states, depending on the initial conditions. Simulation experiments confirm that the time-dependent performance of the stochastic queueing model is well approximated by the fluid model. Like the fluid model, the behavior of the queueing system can be highly sensitive to the initial conditions over long intervals of time.

802,"In this paper we consider a ring of N ≥ 1 queues served by a single server in a cyclic order. After having served a queue (according to a service discipline that may vary from queue to queue), there is a switch-over period and then the server serves the next queue and so forth. This model is known in the literature as a polling model.Each of the queues is fed by a non-decreasing Lévy process, which can be different during each of the consecutive periods within the server’s cycle. The N-dimensional Lévy processes obtained in this fashion are described by their (joint) Laplace exponent, thus allowing for non-independent input streams. For such a system we derive the steady-state distribution of the joint workload at embedded epochs, i.e. polling and switching instants. Using the Kella-Whitt martingale, we also derive the steady-state distribution at an arbitrary epoch.Our analysis heavily relies on establishing a link between fluid (Lévy input) polling systems and multi-type Jiřina processes (continuous-state discrete-time branching processes). This is done by properly defining the notion of the branching property for a discipline, which can be traced back to Fuhrmann and Resing. This definition is broad enough to contain the most important service disciplines, like exhaustive and gated.

803,"We propose and analyze a multi-server model that captures a performance trade-off between centralized and distributed processing. In our model, a fraction p of an available resource is deployed in a centralized manner (e.g., to serve a most-loaded station) while the remaining fraction 1 − p is allocated to local servers that can only serve requests addressed specifically to their respective stations.Using a fluid model approach, we demonstrate a surprising phase transition in the steady-state delay scaling, as p changes: in the limit of a large number of stations, and when any amount of centralization is available (p > 0), the average queue length in steady state scales as log11−p11−λ when the traffic intensity λ goes to 1. This is exponentially smaller than the usual M/M/1-queue delay scaling of 11−λ, obtained when all resources are fully allocated to local stations (p = 0). This indicates a strong qualitative impact of even a small degree of resource pooling.We prove convergence to a fluid limit, and characterize both the transient and steady-state behavior of the actual system, in the limit as the number of stations N goes to infinity. We show that the sequence of queue-length processes converges to a unique fluid trajectory (over any finite time interval, as N → ∞), and that this fluid trajectory converges to a unique invariant state vI, for which a simple closed-form expression is obtained. We also show that the steady-state distribution of the N-server system concentrates on vI as N goes to infinity.

804,"We extend the framework of Neuts’ matrix analytic approach to a reflected process generated by a discrete time multidimensional Markov additive process. This Markov additive process has a general background state space and a real vector valued additive component, and generates a multidimensional reflected process. Our major interest is to derive a closed form formula for the stationary distribution of this reflected process. To this end, we introduce a real valued level, and derive new versions of the Wiener-Hopf factorization for the Markov additive process with the multidimensional additive component. In particular, it is represented by moment generating functions, and we consider the domain for it to be valid.Our framework is general enough to include multi-server queues and/or queueing networks as well as non-linear time series which are currently popular in financial and actuarial mathematics. Our results yield structural results for such models. As an illustration, we apply our results to extend existing results on the tail behavior of reflected processes.A major theme of this work is to connect recent work on matrix analytic methods to classical probabilistic studies on Markov additive processes. Indeed, using purely probabilistic methods such as censoring, duality, level crossing and time-reversal (which are known in the matrix analytic methods community but date back to Arjas & Speed [2] and Pitman [29]), we extend and unify existing results in both areas.

805,"We consider a multi-class queueing network as a model of packet transfer in a communication network. We define a second stochastic model as a model of document transfer in a communication network where the documents transferred have a general distribution. We prove the weak convergence of the multi-class queueing process to the document transfer process. Our convergence result allows the comparison of general document size distributions, and consequently, we prove general insensitivity results for the limit queueing process. We discuss how this separation of time-scales method of proving insensitivity may be applied to other insensitive queueing systems.

806,"We consider a hybrid diffusion process that is a combination of two Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with different restraining forces. This process serves as the heavy-traffic approximation to the Markovian many-server queue with abandonments in the critical Halfin-Whitt regime. We obtain an expression for the Laplace transform of the time-dependent probability distribution, from which the spectral gap is explicitly characterized. The spectral gap gives the exponential rate of convergence to equilibrium. We further give various asymptotic results for the spectral gap, in the limits of small and large abandonment effects. It turns out that convergence to equilibrium becomes extremely slow for overloaded systems with small abandonment effects.

807,"We consider a discrete-time Markov chain (Xt,Yt), t = 0, 1, 2,…, where the X-component forms a Markov chain itself. Assume that (Xt) is Harris-ergodic and consider an auxiliary Markov chain {Ŷt} whose transition probabilities are the averages of transition probabilities of the Y-component of the (X, Y)-chain, where the averaging is weighted by the stationary distribution of the X-component.We first provide natural conditions in terms of test functions ensuring that the Ŷ-chain is positive recurrent and then prove that these conditions are also sufficient for positive recurrence of the original chain (Xt, Yt). The we prove a “multi-dimensional” extension of the result obtained. In the second part of the paper, we apply our results to two versions of a multi-access wireless model governed by two randomised protocols.

808,"A dynamic pricing problem that arises in a revenue management context is considered, involving several resources and several demand classes, each of which uses a particular subset of the resources. The arrival rates of demand are determined by prices, which can be dynamically controlled. When a demand arrives, it pays the posted price for its class and consumes a quantity of each resource commensurate with its class. The time horizon is finite: at time T the demands cease, and a terminal reward (possibly negative) is received that depends on the unsold capacity of each resource. The problem is to choose a dynamic pricing policy to maximize the expected total reward. When viewed in diffusion scale, the problem gives rise to a diffusion control problem whose solution is a Brownian bridge on the time interval [0, T]. We prove diffusion-scale asymptotic optimality of a dynamic pricing policy that mimics the behavior of the Brownian bridge.The ‘target point’ of the Brownian bridge is obtained as the solution of a finite dimensional optimization problem whose structure depends on the terminal reward. We show that, in an airline revenue management problem with no-shows and overbooking, under a realistic assumption on the resource usage of the classes, this finite dimensional optimization problem reduces to a set of newsvendor problems, one for each resource.

809,"For N ≥ 2, we consider an N × N input-queued switch operating under a maximum weight matching policy. We establish a diffusion approximation for a (2N − 1)-dimensional workload process associated with this switch when all input ports and output ports are heavily loaded. The diffusion process is a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion living in a polyhedral cone with N2 boundary faces, each of which has an associated constant direction of reflection. Our proof builds on our own prior work [13] on an invariance principle for semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions in piecewise smooth domains and on a multiplicative state space collapse result for switched networks established by Shah and Wischik in [19].

810,"We consider the asymptotics of the invariant measure for the process of the empirical spatial distribution of N coupled Markov chains in the limit of a large number of chains. Each chain reflects the stochastic evolution of one particle. The chains are coupled through the dependence of the transition rates on this spatial distribution of particles in the various states. Our model is a caricature for medium access interactions in wireless local area networks. It is also applicable to the study of spread of epidemics in a network. The limiting process satisfies a deterministic ordinary differential equation called the McKean-Vlasov equation. When this differential equation has a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium, the spatial distribution asymptotically concentrates on this equilibrium. More generally, its limit points are supported on a subset of the ω-limit sets of the McKean-Vlasov equation. Using a control-theoretic approach, we examine the question of large deviations of the invariant measure from this limit.

811,"We consider large-scale service systems with multiple customer classes and multiple server pools; interarrival and service times are exponentially distributed, and mean service times depend both on the customer class and server pool. It is assumed that the allowed activities (routing choices) form a tree (in the graph with vertices being both customer classes and server pools). We study the behavior of the system under a Leaf Activity Priority (LAP) policy, which assigns static priorities to the activities in the order of sequential “elimination” of the tree leaves.We consider the scaling limit of the system as the arrival rate of customers and number of servers in each pool tend to infinity in proportion to a scaling parameter r, while the overall system load remains strictly subcritical. Indexing the systems by parameter r, we show that (a) the system under LAP discipline is stochastically stable for all sufficiently large r and (b) the family of the invariant distributions is tight on scales r12+𝜖 for all ε > 0. (More precisely, the sequence of invariant distributions, centered at the equilibrium point and scaled down by r−(12+𝜖), is tight.)

812,"The asymptotic pseudo-trajectory approach to stochastic approximation of Benaïm, Hofbauer and Sorin is extended for asynchronous stochastic approximations with a set-valued mean field. The asynchronicity of the process is incorporated into the mean field to produce convergence results which remain similar to those of an equivalent synchronous process. In addition, this allows many of the restrictive assumptions previously associated with asynchronous stochastic approximation to be removed. The framework is extended for a coupled asynchronous stochastic approximation process with set-valued mean fields. Two-timescales arguments are used here in a similar manner to the original work in this area by Borkar. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated through learning in a Markov decision process.

814,"We study the stability of a Markovian model of electricity production and consumption that incorporates production volatility due to renewables and uncertainty about actual demand versus planned production. We assume that the energy producer targets a fixed energy reserve, subject to ramp-up and ramp-down constraints, and that appliances are subject to demand-response signals and adjust their consumption to the available production by delaying their demand. When a constant fraction of the delayed demand vanishes over time, we show that the general state Markov chain characterizing the system is positive Harris and ergodic (i.e., delayed demand is bounded with high probability). However, when delayed demand increases by a constant fraction over time, we show that the Markov chain is non-positive (i.e., there exists a non-zero probability that delayed demand becomes unbounded). We exhibit Lyapunov functions to prove our claims. In addition, we provide examples of heating appliances that, when delayed, have energy requirements corresponding to the two considered cases.

815,"We consider the simulation-based solution of linear systems of equations, Ax = b, of various types frequently arising in large-scale applications, where A is singular. We show that the convergence properties of iterative solution methods are frequently lost when they are implemented with simulation (e.g., using sample average approximation), as is often done in important classes of large-scale problems. We focus on special cases of algorithms for singular systems, including some arising in least squares problems and approximate dynamic programming, where convergence of the residual sequence {Axk − b} may be obtained, while the sequence of iterates {xk} may diverge. For some of these special cases, under additional assumptions, we show that the iterate sequence is guaranteed to converge. For situations where the iterates diverge but the residuals converge to zero, we propose schemes for extracting from the divergent sequence another sequence that converges to a solution of Ax = b.

816,"We use a multidimensional diffusion process to approximate the dynamics of a queue served by many parallel servers. Waiting customers in this queue may abandon the system without service. To analyze the diffusion model, we develop a numerical algorithm for computing its stationary distribution. A crucial part of the algorithm is choosing an appropriate reference density. Using a conjecture on the tail behavior of the limit queue length process, we propose a systematic approach to constructing a reference density. With the proposed reference density, the algorithm is shown to converge quickly in numerical experiments. These experiments demonstrate that the diffusion model is a satisfactory approximation for many-server queues, sometimes for queues with as few as twenty servers.

817,"Given two distributions F and G on the nonnegative integers we propose an algorithm to construct in- and out-degree sequences from samples of i.i.d. observations from F and G, respectively, that with high probability will be graphical, that is, from which a simple directed graph can be drawn. We then analyze a directed version of the configuration model and show that, provided that F and G have finite variance, the probability of obtaining a simple graph is bounded away from zero as the number of nodes grows. We show that conditional on the resulting graph being simple, the in- and out-degree distributions are (approximately) F and G for large size graphs. Moreover, when the degree distributions have only finite mean we show that the elimination of self-loops and multiple edges does not significantly change the degree distributions in the resulting simple graph.

818,"We study the variational problem that arises from consideration of large deviations for semimartingale reflected Brownian motion (SRBM) in ℝ+3. Due to the difficulty of the general problem, we consider the case in which the SRBM has rotationally symmetric parameters. In this case, we are able to obtain conditions under which the optimal solutions to the variational problem are paths that are gradual (moving through faces of strictly increasing dimension) or that spiral around the boundary of the octant. Furthermore, these results allow us to provide an example for which it can be verified that a spiral path is optimal. For rotationally symmetric SRBM’s, our results facilitate the simplification of computational methods for determining optimal solutions to variational problems and give insight into large deviations behavior of these processes.

819,"We consider a two–armed bandit problem which involves sequential sampling from two non-homogeneous populations. The response in each is determined by a random covariate vector and a vector of parameters whose values are not known a priori. The goal is to maximize cumulative expected reward. We study this problem in a minimax setting, and develop rate-optimal polices that combine myopic action based on least squares estimates with a suitable “forced sampling” strategy. It is shown that the regret grows logarithmically in the time horizon n and no policy can achieve a slower growth rate over all feasible problem instances. In this setting of linear response bandits, the identity of the sub-optimal action changes with the values of the covariate vector, and the optimal policy is subject to sampling from the inferior population at a rate that grows like n.

820,"We consider an overloaded multiclass nonidling first-in-first-out single-server queue with abandonment. The interarrival times, service times, and deadline times are sequences of independent and identically, but generally distributed random variables. In prior work, Jennings and Reed studied the workload process associated with this queue. Under mild conditions, they establish both a functional law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for this process. We build on that work here. For this, we consider a more detailed description of the system state given by K finite, nonnegative Borel measures on the nonnegative quadrant, one for each job class. For each time and job class, the associated measure has a unit atom associated with each job of that class in the system at the coordinates determined by what are referred to as the residual virtual sojourn time and residual patience time of that job. Under mild conditions, we prove a functional law of large numbers for this measure-valued state descriptor. This yields approximations for related processes such as the queue lengths and abandoning queue lengths. An interesting characteristic of these approximations is that they depend on the deadline distributions in their entirety.

821,"In this paper we consider approximate dynamic programming methods for ambulance redeployment. We first demonstrate through simple examples how typical value function fitting techniques, such as approximate policy iteration and linear programming, may not be able to locate a high-quality policy even when the value function approximation architecture is rich enough to provide the optimal policy. To make up for this potential shortcoming, we show how to use direct search methods to tune the parameters in a value function approximation architecture so as to obtain high-quality policies. Direct search is computationally intensive. We therefore use a post-decision state dynamic programming formulation of ambulance redeployment that, together with direct search, requires far less computation with no noticeable performance loss. We provide further theoretical support for the post-decision state formulation of the ambulance-deployment problem by showing that this formulation can be obtained through a limiting argument on the original dynamic programming formulation.

822,"We consider the structure learning problem for graphical models that we call loosely connected Markov random fields, in which the number of short paths between any pair of nodes is small, and present a new conditional independence test based algorithm for learning the underlying graph structure. The novel maximization step in our algorithm ensures that the true edges are detected correctly even when there are short cycles in the graph. The number of samples required by our algorithm is C log p, where p is the size of the graph and the constant C depends on the parameters of the model. We show that several previously studied models are examples of loosely connected Markov random fields, and our algorithm achieves the same or lower computational complexity than the previously designed algorithms for individual cases. We also get new results for more general graphical models, in particular, our algorithm learns general Ising models on the Erdős-Rényi random graph 𝒢(p,cp) correctly with running time O(np5).

823,"A supermarket game is considered with N FCFS queues with unit exponential service rate and global Poisson arrival rate Nλ. Upon arrival each customer chooses a number of queues to be sampled uniformly at random and joins the least loaded sampled queue. Customers are assumed to have cost for both waiting and sampling, and they want to minimize their own expected total cost.We study the supermarket game in a mean field model that corresponds to the limit as N converges to infinity in the sense that (i) for a fixed symmetric customer strategy, the joint equilibrium distribution of any fixed number of queues converges as N → ∞ to a product distribution determined by the mean field model and (ii) a Nash equilibrium for the mean field model is an ε-Nash equilibrium for the finite N model with N sufficiently large. It is shown that there always exists a Nash equilibrium for λ < 1 and the Nash equilibrium is unique with homogeneous waiting cost for λ≤1/2. Furthermore, we find that the action of sampling more queues by some customers has a positive externality on the other customers in the mean field model, but can have a negative externality for finite N.

824,"We consider an inventory system in which inventory level fluctuates as a Brownian motion in the absence of control. The inventory continuously accumulates cost at a rate that is a general convex function of the inventory level, which can be negative when there is a backlog. At any time, the inventory level can be adjusted by a positive or negative amount, which incurs a fixed cost and a proportional cost. The challenge is to find an adjustment policy that balances the holding cost and adjustment cost to minimize the long-run average cost. When both upward and downward fixed costs are positive, our problem is an impulse control problem. When both fixed costs are zero, our problem is a singular or instantaneous control problem. For the impulse control problem, we prove that a four-parameter control band policy is optimal among all feasible policies. For the singular control problem, we prove that a two-parameter control band policy is optimal.We use a lower-bound approach, widely known as the “verification theorem”, to prove the optimality of a control band policy for both the impulse and singular control problems. Our major contribution is to prove the existence of a “smooth” solution to the free boundary problem under some mild assumptions on the holding cost function. The existence proof leads naturally to a numerical algorithm to compute the optimal control band parameters. We demonstrate that the lower-bound approach also works for a Brownian inventory model which prohibits an inventory backlog. A companion paper (“Brownian inventory models with convex holding cost, part 2: discount-optimal controls”, Stochastic Systems, Vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 500–573) explains how to adapt the lower-bound approach to study a Brownian inventory model under a discounted cost criterion.

825,"We consider an inventory system in which inventory level fluctuates as a Brownian motion in the absence of control. The inventory continuously accumulates cost at a rate that is a general convex function of the inventory level, which can be negative when there is a backlog. At any time, the inventory level can be adjusted by a positive or negative amount, which incurs a fixed positive cost and a proportional cost. The challenge is to find an adjustment policy that balances the inventory cost and adjustment cost to minimize the expected total discounted cost. We provide a tutorial on using a three-step lower-bound approach to solving the optimal control problem under a discounted cost criterion. In addition, we prove that a four-parameter control band policy is optimal among all feasible policies. A key step is the constructive proof of the existence of a unique solution to the free boundary problem. The proof leads naturally to an algorithm to compute the four parameters of the optimal control band policy.

826,"We consider a pair of coupled queues driven by independent spectrally-positive Lévy processes. With respect to the bi-variate workload process this framework includes both the coupled processor model and the two-server fluid network with independent Lévy inputs. We identify the joint transform of the stationary workload distribution in terms of Wiener-Hopf factors corresponding to two auxiliary Lévy processes with explicit Laplace exponents. We reinterpret and extend the ideas of Cohen and Boxma (1983) to provide a general and uniform result with a neat transform expression.

828,"User profiling is a useful primitive for constructing personalised services, such as content recommendation. In the present paper we investigate the feasibility of user profiling in a distributed setting, with no central authority and only local information exchanges between users. We compute a profile vector for each user (i.e., a low-dimensional vector that characterises her taste) via spectral transformation of observed user-produced ratings for items. Our two main contributions follow:(i) We consider a low-rank probabilistic model of user taste. More specifically, we consider that users and items are partitioned in a constant number of classes, such that users and items within the same class are statistically identical. We prove that without prior knowledge of the compositions of the classes, based solely on few random observed ratings (namely O(N log N) such ratings for N users), we can predict user preference with high probability for unrated items by running a local vote among users with similar profile vectors. In addition, we provide empirical evaluations characterising the way in which spectral profiling performance depends on the dimension of the profile space. Such evaluations are performed on a data set of real user ratings provided by Netflix.(ii) We develop distributed algorithms which provably achieve an embedding of users into a low-dimensional space, based on spectral transformation. These involve simple message passing among users, and provably converge to the desired embedding.

830,"We use fluid limits to explore the (in)stability properties of wireless networks with queue-based random-access algorithms. Queue-based random-access schemes are simple and inherently distributed in nature, yet provide the capability to match the optimal throughput performance of centralized scheduling mechanisms in a wide range of scenarios. Unfortunately, the type of activation rules for which throughput optimality has been established, may result in excessive queue lengths and delays. The use of more aggressive/persistent access schemes can improve the delay performance, but does not offer any universal maximum-stability guarantees.In order to gain qualitative insight and investigate the (in)stability properties of more aggressive/persistent activation rules, we examine fluid limits where the dynamics are scaled in space and time. In some situations, the fluid limits have smooth deterministic features and maximum stability is maintained, while in other scenarios they exhibit random oscillatory characteristics, giving rise to major technical challenges. In the latter regime, more aggressive access schemes continue to provide maximum stability in some networks, but may cause instability in others. In order to prove that, we focus on a particular network example and conduct a detailed analysis of the fluid limit process for the associated Markov chain. Specifically, we develop a novel approach based on stopping time sequences to deal with the switching probabilities governing the sample paths of the fluid limit process. Simulation experiments are conducted to illustrate and validate the analytical results.

831,"In this paper we study a spectrally negative Lévy process which is refracted at its running maximum and at the same time reflected from below at a certain level. Such a process can for instance be used to model an insurance surplus process subject to tax payments according to a loss-carry-forward scheme together with the flow of minimal capital injections required to keep the surplus process non-negative. We characterize the first passage time over an arbitrary level and the cumulative amount of injected capital up to this time by their joint Laplace transform, and show that it satisfies a simple power relation to the case without refraction, generalizing results by Albrecher and Hipp (2007) and Albrecher, Renaud and Zhou (2008). It turns out that this identity can also be extended to a certain type of refraction from below. The net present value of tax collected before the cumulative injected capital exceeds a certain amount is determined, and a numerical illustration is provided.

832,"Under different assumptions on the distribution of the fading random variables, we derive large deviation estimates for the tail of the interference in a wireless network model whose nodes are placed, over a bounded region of the plane, according to the β-Ginibre process, 0 < β ≤ 1. The family of β-Ginibre processes is formed by determinantal point processes, with different degree of repulsiveness. As β→ 0, β-Ginibre processes converge in law to a homogeneous Poisson process. In this sense the Poisson network model may be considered as the limiting uncorrelated case of the β-Ginibre network model. Our results indicate the existence of two different regimes.When the fading random variables are bounded or Weibull superexponential, large values of the interference are typically originated by the sum of several equivalent interfering contributions due to nodes in the vicinity of the receiver. In this case, the tail of the interference has, on the log-scale, the same asymptotic behavior for any value of 0 < β≤ 1, but it differs from the asymptotic behavior of the tail of the interference in the Poisson network model (again on a log-scale) [14].When the fading random variables are exponential or subexponential, instead, large values of the interference are typically originated by a single dominating interferer node and, on the log-scale, the asymptotic behavior of the tail of the interference is insensitive to the distribution of the nodes, as long as the number of nodes is guaranteed to be light-tailed.

833,"Let Qλ(t, y) be the number of people present at time t with at least y units of remaining service time in an infinite server system with arrival rate equal to λ > 0. In the presence of a non-lattice renewal arrival process and assuming that the service times have a continuous distribution, we obtain a large deviations principle for Qλ(·)/λ under the topology of uniform convergence on [0, T] × [0, ∞). We illustrate our results by obtaining the most likely paths, represented as surfaces, to overflow in the setting of loss queues, and also to ruin in life insurance portfolios.

834,"We consider a queueing system with J parallel servers 𝒮={m1,…,mJ}, and with customer types 𝒞 = {a, b, …}. A bipartite graph G describes which pairs of server-customer types are compatible. We consider FCFS-ALIS policy: A server always picks the first, longest waiting compatible customer, and a customer is always assigned to the longest idle compatible server. We assume Poisson arrivals and server dependent exponential service times. We derive an explicit product-form expression for the stationary distribution of this system when service capacity is sufficient. We also calculate fluid limits of the system under overload, to show that local steady state exists. We distinguish the case of complete resource pooling when all the customers are served at the same rate by the pooled servers, and the case when the system has a unique decomposition into subsets of customer types, each of which is served at its own rate by a pooled subset of the servers. Finally, we discuss possible behavior of the system with generally distributed abandonments, under many server scaling. This paper complements and extends previous results of Kaplan, Caldentey and Weiss [18], and of Whitt and Talreja [34], as well as previous results of the authors [4, 35] on this topic.

835,"The busy period for a queue is cast as the area swept under the random walk until it first returns to zero. Encompassing non-i.i.d. increments, the large-deviations asymptotics of the busy period B is addressed, under the assumption that the increments satisfy standard conditions, including a negative drift. The main conclusions provide insight on the probability of a large busy period, and the manner in which this occurs. The scaled probability of a large busy period has the asymptote, for any b > 0, limn→∞(1/n)logP(B≥bn)=−Kb, where K=2−∫0λ*Λ(θ)dθ, with λ*=sup{θ:Λ(θ)≤0}, and with Λ denoting the scaled cumulant generating function of the increments process. The most likely path to a large swept area is found to be a simple rescaling of the path on [0, 1] given by ψ*(t)=−Λ(λ*(1−t))/λ*. In contrast to the piecewise linear most likely path leading the random walk to hit a high level, this is strictly concave in general. While these two most likely paths have distinctly different forms, their derivatives coincide at the start of their trajectories, and at their first return to zero.These results partially answer an open problem of Kulick and Palmowski [18] regarding the tail of the work done during a busy period at a single server queue. The paper concludes with applications of these results to the estimation of the busy period statistics (λ*, K) based on observations of the increments, offering the possibility of estimating the likelihood of a large busy period in advance of observing one.

836,"We develop importance sampling based efficient simulation techniques for three commonly encountered rare event probabilities associated with random walks having i.i.d. regularly varying increments; namely, 1) the large deviation probabilities, 2) the level crossing probabilities, and 3) the level crossing probabilities within a regenerative cycle. Exponential twisting based state-independent methods, which are effective in efficiently estimating these probabilities for light-tailed increments are not applicable when the increments are heavy-tailed. To address the latter case, more complex and elegant state-dependent efficient simulation algorithms have been developed in the literature over the last few years. We propose that by suitably decomposing these rare event probabilities into a dominant and further residual components, simpler state-independent importance sampling algorithms can be devised for each component resulting in composite unbiased estimators with desirable efficiency properties. When the increments have infinite variance, there is an added complexity in estimating the level crossing probabilities as even the well known zero-variance measures have an infinite expected termination time. We adapt our algorithms so that this expectation is finite while the estimators remain strongly efficient. Numerically, the proposed estimators perform at least as well, and sometimes substantially better than the existing state-dependent estimators in the literature.

837,"In this note we study the behavior of maximum quasilikelihood estimators (MQLEs) for a class of statistical models, in which only knowledge about the first two moments of the response variable is assumed. This class includes, but is not restricted to, generalized linear models with general link function. Our main results are related to guarantees on existence, strong consistency and mean square convergence rates of MQLEs. The rates are obtained from first principles and are stronger than known a.s. rates. Our results find important application in sequential decision problems with parametric uncertainty arising in dynamic pricing.

838,"In this paper we propose an inversion algorithm with computable error bounds for two-dimensional, two-sided Laplace transforms. The algorithm consists of two discretization parameters and two truncation parameters. Based on the computable error bounds, we can select these parameters appropriately to achieve any desired accuracy. Hence this algorithm is particularly useful to provide benchmarks. In many cases, the error bounds decay quickly (e.g., exponentially), making the algorithm very efficient. We apply this algorithm to price exotic options such as spread options and barrier options under various asset pricing models as well as to evaluate the joint cumulative distribution functions of related state variables. The numerical examples indicate that the inversion algorithm is accurate, fast and easy to implement.

839,"In multi-class communication networks, traffic surges due to one class of users can significantly degrade the performance for other classes. During these transient periods, it is thus of crucial importance to implement priority mechanisms that conserve the quality of service experienced by the affected classes, while ensuring that the temporarily unstable class is not entirely neglected. In this paper, we examine the complex interaction occurring between several classes of traffic when classes obtain bandwidth proportionally to their incoming traffic. We characterize the evolution of the performance measures of the network from the moment the initial surge takes place until the system reaches its equilibrium. Using a time-space-transition-scaling, we show that the trajectories of the temporarily unstable class can be described by a differential equation, while those of the stable classes retain their stochastic nature. In particular, we show that the temporarily unstable class evolves at a time-scale which is much slower than that of the stable classes. Although the time-scales decouple, the dynamics of the temporarily unstable and the stable classes continue to influence one another. We further proceed to characterize the obtained differential equations for several simple network examples. In particular, the macroscopic asymptotic behavior of the unstable class allows us to gain important qualitative insights on how the bandwidth allocation affects performance. We illustrate these results on several toy examples and we finally build a penalization rule using these results for a network integrating streaming and surging elastic traffic.

840,"We consider the optimal control of matching queues with random arrivals. In this model, items arrive to dedicated queues, and wait to be matched with items from other (possibly multiple) queues. A match type corresponds to the set of item classes required for a match. Once a decision has been made to perform a match, the matching itself is instantaneous and the matched items depart from the system. We consider the problem of minimizing finite-horizon cumulative holding costs. The controller must decide which matchings to execute given multiple options. In principle, the controller may choose to wait until some “inventory” of items builds up to facilitate more profitable matches in the future.We introduce a multi-dimensional imbalance process, that at each time t, is given by a linear function of the cumulative arrivals to each of the item classes. A non-zero value of the imbalance at time t means that no control could have matched all the items that arrived by time t. A lower bound based on the imbalance process can be specified, at each time point, by a solution to an optimization problem with linear constraints. While not achievable in general, this lower bound can be asymptotically approached under a dedicated item condition (an analogue of the local traffic condition in bandwidth sharing networks). We devise a myopic discrete-review matching control that asymptotically–as the arrival rates become large–achieves the imbalance-based lower bound.

841,"This paper provides an overview of the resource sharing networks introduced by Massoulié and Roberts [20] to model the dynamic behavior of Internet flows. Striving to separate the model class from the applications that motivated its development, we assume no prior knowledge of communication networks. The paper also presents an open problem, along with simulation results, a formal analysis, and a selective literature review that provide context and motivation. The open problem is to devise a policy for dynamic resource allocation that achieves what we call hierarchical greedy ideal (HGI) performance in the heavy traffic limit. The existence of such a policy is suggested by formal analysis of an approximating Brownian control problem, assuming that there is “local traffic” on each processing resource.
",We study the problem of finding a “best” equilibrium in a network of servers. We propose a new approach to solve the problem by using a dynamic programming model to capture the dynamics of the network. We show that the dynamic programming model can be used to capture the dynamics of the network and the dynamics of the server. We also show that the dynamic programming model can be used to capture the dynamics of the server and the dynamics of the server’s network. We also show that the dynamic programming model can be used to capture the dynamics of the server and the dynamics of the server’s network. We discuss the implications of our results for the literature on network dynamics and the network design.  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \,0.6187358,0.6595538,-0.4996435,1.5352463,0.9366279,0.44778052,0.39177135,0.67414385,0.86559284,0.8825179,0.36409983,0.9182221,-0.69839483,0.8300594,0.4730345,0.6796753,0.13755919,1.0830432,-0.06973942,-1.1561154,-0.1606012,-0.118722424,1.5439885,0.2326466,-0.42459384,-0.26638252,0.6938486,-1.0126407,-0.9024657,-0.7344548,-0.08371718,1.0175391,0.088846065,-0.8645232,0.6141953,0.30252603,-0.9698193,-0.25888595,-0.682443,0.397048,-0.30499673,-1.0561082,1.1498915,1.2647228,0.2634085,0.7435027,1.7364732,-1.7499461,-1.1041036,-1.2997772,1.2544042,0.73637617,-0.07288641,-1.0534964,-0.22846617,-1.7139385,-0.44251844,0.9844447,1.0930247,0.28329572,0.67594576,0.6767803,-0.09511263,0.8878451,-0.741785,0.19490099,-0.15923221,0.676321,0.4139371,0.70354354,-1.1461328,0.3367301,0.7292734,-0.6363167,-0.5733025,0.54753315,-1.1577445,-0.38387465,0.6631194,-0.43779105,2.4984052,-1.4278163,-0.54089206,-0.2738345,-0.3723559,0.34814012,-0.850509,-0.3945174,0.045056567,0.35039556,-0.3641068,-0.22861436,-0.03119802,1.3250861,0.13650252,-0.04100947,0.79523605,-0.11018505,0.19066794,0.4618334,-0.22170101,0.3666457,-0.7724427,-0.07823805,-0.7120695,0.4731279,-0.74519503,1.1221136,1.1827468,-0.4425966,0.558982,0.46602014,-0.091704525,0.22892211,-0.3789583,0.6128508,0.4834683,-0.13063733,-1.3074703,0.60375077,-1.5287879,-0.302164,1.0598813,1.2945058,-0.17916991,-0.3750019,0.09037937,0.6672235
842,"For a multiclass G/G/1 queue with finite buffers, admission and scheduling control, and holding and rejection costs, we construct a policy that is asymptotically optimal in the heavy traffic limit. The policy is specified in terms of a single parameter which constitutes the free boundary point from the Harrison-Taksar free boundary problem, but otherwise depends explicitly on the problem data. The cμ priority rule is also used by the policy, but in a way that is novel, and, in particular, different than that used in problems with infinite buffers. We also address an analogous problem where buffer constraints are replaced by throughput time constraints.

843,"We study a double-ended queue where buyers and sellers arrive to conduct trades. When there is a pair of buyer and seller in the system, they immediately transact a trade and leave. Thus there cannot be a non-zero number of buyers and sellers simultaneously in the system. We assume that sellers and buyers arrive at the system according to independent renewal processes, and they would leave the system after independent exponential patience times. We establish fluid and diffusion approximations for the queue length process under a suitable asymptotic regime. The fluid limit is the solution of an ordinary differential equation, and the diffusion limit is a time-inhomogeneous asymmetric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (O-U process). A heavy traffic analysis is also developed, and the diffusion limit in the stronger heavy traffic regime is a time-homogeneous asymmetric O-U process. The limiting distributions of both diffusion limits are obtained. We also show the interchange of the heavy traffic and steady state limits.

844,"Ramaswami showed recently that standard Brownian motion arises as the limit of a family of Markov-modulated linear fluid processes. We pursue this analysis with a fluid approximation for Markov-modulated Brownian motion. We follow a Markov-renewal approach and we prove that the stationary distribution of a Markov-modulated Brownian motion reflected at zero is the limit from the well-analyzed stationary distribution of approximating linear fluid processes. Thus, we provide a new approach for obtaining the stationary distribution of a reflected MMBM without time-reversal or solving partial differential equations. Our results open the way to the analysis of more complex Markov-modulated processes.Key matrices in the limiting stationary distribution are shown to be solutions of a matrix-quadratic equation, and we describe how this equation can be efficiently solved.

846,"We consider a queueing system composed of a dispatcher that routes jobs to a set of non-observable queues working in parallel. In this setting, the fundamental problem is which policy should the dispatcher implement to minimize the stationary mean waiting time of the incoming jobs. We present a structural property that holds in the classic scaling of the system where the network demand (arrival rate of jobs) grows proportionally with the number of queues. Assuming that each queue of type r is replicated k times, we consider a set of policies that are periodic with period k∑rpr and such that exactly pr jobs are sent in a period to each queue of type r. When k → ∞, our main result shows that all the policies in this set are equivalent, in the sense that they yield the same mean stationary waiting time, and optimal, in the sense that no other policy having the same aggregate arrival rate to all queues of a given type can do better in minimizing the stationary mean waiting time. This property holds in a strong probabilistic sense. Furthermore, the limiting mean waiting time achieved by our policies is a convex function of the arrival rate in each queue, which facilitates the development of a further optimization aimed at solving the fundamental problem above for large systems.

847,"Hospitals are complex systems with essential societal benefits and huge mounting costs. These costs are exacerbated by inefficiencies in hospital processes, which are often manifested by congestion and long delays in patient care. Thus, a queueing-network view of patient flow in hospitals is natural for studying and improving its performance. The goal of our research is to explore patient flow data through the lens of a queueing scientist. The means is exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a large Israeli hospital, which reveals important features that are not readily explainable by existing models.Questions raised by our EDA include: Can a simple (parsimonious) queueing model usefully capture the complex operational reality of the Emergency Department (ED)? What time scales and operational regimes are relevant for modeling patient length of stay in the Internal Wards (IWs)? How do protocols of patient transfer between the ED and the IWs influence patient delay, workload division and fairness? EDA also underscores the importance of an integrative view of hospital units by, for example, relating ED bottlenecks to IW physician protocols. The significance of such questions and our related findings raise the need for novel queueing models and theory, which we present here as research opportunities.Hospital data, and specifically patient flow data at the level of the individual patient, is increasingly collected but is typically confidential and/or proprietary. We have been fortunate to partner with a hospital that allowed us to open up its data for everyone to access. This enables reproducibility of our findings, through a user-friendly platform that is accessible via the Technion SEELab.

849,"A large-scale flexible service system with two large server pools and two types of customers is considered. Servers in pool 1 can only serve type 1 customers, while server in pool 2 are flexible – they can serve both types 1 and 2. (This is a so-called “N-system.”) The customer arrival processes are Poisson and customer service requirements are independent exponentially distributed. The service rate of a customer depends both on its type and the pool where it is served. A priority service discipline, where type 2 has priority in pool 2, and type 1 prefers pool 1, is considered. We consider the Halfin-Whitt asymptotic regime, where the arrival rate of customers and the number of servers in each pool increase to infinity in proportion to a scaling parameter n, while the overall system capacity exceeds its load by O(√n).For this system we prove tightness of diffusion-scaled stationary distributions. Our approach relies on a single common Lyapunov function G(n)(x), depending on parameter n and defined on the entire state space as a functional of the drift-based fluid limits (DFL). Specifically, G(n)(x)=∫∞0g(y(n)(t))dt, where y(n)(·) is the DFL starting at x, and g(·) is a “distance” to the origin. (g(·) is same for all n). The key part of the analysis is the study of the (first and second) derivatives of the DFLs and function G(n)(x). The approach, as well as many parts of the analysis, are quite generic and may be of independent interest.

850,"We consider a network revenue management problem and advance its dual formulation. The dual formulation reveals that the (optimal) shadow price of capacity forms a nonnegative martingale. This result is proved under minimal assumptions on network topology and stochastic nature of demand, allowing an arbitrary statistical dependence structure across time and products. Next, we consider a quadratic perturbation of the network revenue management problem and show that a simple (perturbed) bid-price control is optimal for the perturbed problem; and it is ɛ-optimal for the original network revenue management problem. Finally, we consider a predictable version of this control, where the bid prices used in the current period are last updated in the previous period, and provide an upper bound on its optimality gap in terms of the (quadratic) variation of demand. Using this upper bound we show that there exists a near-optimal such control in the usual case when periods are small compared to the planning horizon provided that either demand or the incremental information arriving during each period is small. We establish the martingale property of the (near) optimal bid prices in both settings. The martingale property can have important implications in practice as it may offer a tool for monitoring the revenue management systems.

851,"We model the problem of managing capacity in a build-to-order environment as a Brownian drift control problem. We formulate a structured linear program that models a practical discretization of the problem and exploit a strong relationship between relative value functions and dual solutions to develop a functional lower bound for the continuous problem from a dual solution to the discrete problem. Refining the discretization proves a functional strong duality for the continuous problem. The linear programming formulation is so badly scaled, however, that solving it is beyond the capabilities of standard solvers. By demonstrating the equivalence between strongly feasible bases and deterministic unichain policies, we combinatorialize the pivoting process and by exploiting the relationship between dual solutions and relative value functions, develop a mechanism for solving the LP without ever computing its coefficients. Finally, we exploit the relationship between relative value functions and dual solutions to develop a scheme analogous to column generation for refining the discretization so as to drive the gap between the discrete approximation and the continuous problem to zero quickly while keeping the LP small. Computational studies show our scheme is much faster than simply solving a regular discretization of the problem both in terms of finding a policy with a low average cost and in terms of providing a lower bound on the optimal average cost.

852,"We study the problem of the existence of a giant component in a random multipartite graph. We consider a random multipartite graph with p parts generated according to a given degree sequence nid(n),n≥1 which denotes the number of vertices in part i of the multipartite graph with degree given by the vector d in an n-node graph. We assume that the empirical distribution of the degree sequence converges to a limiting probability distribution. Under certain mild regularity assumptions, we characterize the conditions under which, with high probability, there exists a component of linear size. The characterization involves checking whether the Perron-Frobenius norm of the matrix of means of a certain associated edge-biased distribution is greater than unity. We also specify the size of the giant component when it exists. We use the exploration process of Molloy and Reed Molloy and Reed (1995) to analyze the size of components in the random graph. The main challenges arise due to the multidimensionality of the random processes involved which prevents us from directly applying the techniques from the standard unipartite case. In this paper we use techniques from the theory of multidimensional Galton-Watson processes along with Lyapunov function technique to overcome the challenges.

853,"We study the optimal scaling of the expected total queue size in an n × n input-queued switch, as a function of the number of ports n and the load factor ρ, which has been conjectured to be Θ(n/(1 − ρ)) (cf. [15]). In a recent work [16], the validity of this conjecture has been established for the regime where 1 − ρ = O(1/n2). In this paper, we make further progress in the direction of this conjecture. We provide a new class of scheduling policies under which the expected total queue size scales as O(n1.5(1 − ρ)−1 log (1/(1 − ρ))) when 1 − ρ = O(1/n). This is an improvement over the state of the art; for example, for ρ = 1 − 1/n the best known bound was O(n3), while ours is O(n2.5 log n).

854,"We consider a dynamic scheduling problem for parallel server systems. J. M. Harrison has proposed a scheme for using diffusion control problems to approximately solve such control problems for heavily loaded systems. This approach has been very successfully used in the special case when the diffusion control problem can be reduced to an equivalent one for a one-dimensional workload process. However, it remains a challenging open problem to make substantial progress on using Harrison’s scheme when the workload process is more than one-dimensional. Here we present some new structural results concerning the diffusion control problem for parallel server systems with arbitrary workload dimension. Specifically, we prove that a certain server-buffer graph associated with a parallel server system is a forest of trees. We then exploit this graphical structure to prove that there exists a matrix, used to define the workload process, that has a block diagonal-like structure. An important feature of this matrix is that, except when the workload is one-dimensional, this matrix is frequently different from a choice of workload matrix proposed by Harrison. We demonstrate that our workload matrix simplifies the structure of the control problem for the workload process by proving that when the original diffusion control problem has linear holding costs, the equivalent workload formulation also has a linear cost function. We also use this simplification to give sufficient conditions for a certain least control process to be an optimal control for the diffusion control problem with linear holding costs. Under these conditions, we propose a continuous review threshold-type control policy for the original parallel server system that exploits pooling of servers within trees in the server-buffer graph and uses non-basic activities connecting different trees in a critical manner. We call this partial pooling. We conjecture that this threshold policy is asymptotically optimal in the heavy traffic limit. We illustrate the solution of the diffusion control problem and our proposed threshold control policy for a three-buffer, three-server example.

855,"We consider the problem of assignning jobs to servers in a multi-server system consisting of N parallel processor sharing servers, categorized into M (≪ N) different types according to their processing capacities or speeds. Jobs of random sizes arrive at the system according to a Poisson process with rate Nλ. Upon each arrival, some servers of each type are sampled uniformly at random. The job is then assigned to one of the sampled servers based on their states. We propose two schemes, which differ in the metric for choosing the destination server for each arriving job. Our aim is to reduce the mean sojourn time of the jobs in the system.It is shown that the proposed schemes achieve the maximal stability region, without requiring the knowledge of the system parameters. The performance of the system operating under the proposed schemes is analyzed in the limit as N → ∞. This gives rise to a mean field limit. The mean field is shown to have a unique, globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point which approximates the stationary distribution of load at each server. Asymptotic independence among the servers is established using a notion of intra-type exchangeability which generalizes the usual notion of exchangeability. It is further shown that the tail distribution of server occupancies decays doubly exponentially for each server type. Numerical evidence shows that at high load the proposed schemes perform at least as well as other schemes that require more knowledge of the system parameters.

856,"Routing mechanisms for stochastic networks are often designed to produce state space collapse (SSC) in a heavy-traffic limit, i.e., to confine the limiting process to a lower-dimensional subset of its full state space. In a fluid limit, a control producing asymptotic SSC corresponds to an ideal sliding mode control that forces the fluid trajectories to a lower-dimensional sliding manifold. Within deterministic dynamical systems theory, it is well known that sliding-mode controls can cause the system to chatter back and forth along the sliding manifold due to delays in activation of the control. For the prelimit stochastic system, chattering implies fluid-scaled fluctuations that are larger than typical stochastic fluctuations.In this paper we show that chattering can occur in the fluid limit of a controlled stochastic network when inappropriate control parameters are used. The model has two large service pools operating under the fixed-queue-ratio with activation and release thresholds (FQR-ART) overload control which we proposed in a recent paper. The FQR-ART control is designed to produce asymptotic SSC by automatically activating sharing (sending some customers from one class to the other service pool) once an overload occurs. We have previously shown that this control is effective and robust, even if the service rates are less for the other shared customers, when the control parameters are chosen properly. We now show that, if the control parameters are not chosen properly, then delays in activating and releasing the control can cause chattering with large oscillations in the fluid limit. In turn, these fluid-scaled fluctuations lead to severe congestion, even when the arrival rates are smaller than the potential total service rate in the system, a phenomenon referred to as congestion collapse. We show that the fluid limit can be a bi-stable switching system possessing a unique nontrivial periodic equilibrium, in addition to a unique stationary point.

857,"We consider a switch operating under the MaxWeight scheduling algorithm, under any traffic pattern such that all the ports are loaded. This system is interesting to study since the queue lengths exhibit a multi-dimensional state-space collapse in the heavy-traffic regime. We use a Lyapunov-type drift technique to characterize the heavy-traffic behavior of the expectation of the sum queue lengths in steady-state, under the assumption that all ports are saturated and all queues receive non-zero traffic. Under these conditions, we show that the heavy-traffic scaled queue length is given by (1−12n)||σ||2, where σ is the vector of the standard deviations of arrivals to each port in the heavy-traffic limit. In the special case of uniform Bernoulli arrivals, the corresponding formula is given by (n−32+12n). The result shows that the heavy-traffic scaled queue length has optimal scaling with respect to n, thus settling one version of an open conjecture; in fact, it is shown that the heavy-traffic queue length is at most within a factor of two from the optimal. We then consider certain asymptotic regimes where the load of the system scales simultaneously with the number of ports. We show that the MaxWeight algorithm has optimal queue length scaling behavior provided that the arrival rate approaches capacity sufficiently fast.

858,"In this paper, we develop a new approach to studying the asymptotic behavior of fluid model solutions for critically loaded processor sharing queues. For this, we introduce a notion of relative entropy associated with measure-valued fluid model solutions. In contrast to the approach used in [12], which does not readily generalize to networks of processor sharing queues, we expect the approach developed in this paper to be more robust. Indeed, we anticipate that similar notions involving relative entropy may be helpful for understanding the asymptotic behavior of critical fluid model solutions for stochastic networks operating under various resource sharing protocols naturally described by measure-valued processes.

859,"This paper provides an introduction to the Stein method framework in the context of steady-state diffusion approximations. The framework consists of three components: the Poisson equation and gradient bounds, generator coupling, and moment bounds. Working in the setting of the Erlang-A and Erlang-C models, we prove that both Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the stationary distribution of a normalized customer count process, and that of an appropriately defined diffusion process decrease at a rate of 1/R, where R is the offered load. Futhermore, these error bounds are universal, valid in any load condition from lightly loaded to heavily loaded.

860,"Particle island models [31] provide a means of parallelization of sequential Monte Carlo methods, and in this paper we present novel convergence results for algorithms of this sort. In particular we establish a central limit theorem—as the number of islands and the common size of the islands tend jointly to infinity—of the double bootstrap algorithm with possibly adaptive selection on the island level. For this purpose we introduce a notion of archipelagos of weighted islands and find conditions under which a set of convergence properties are preserved by different operations on such archipelagos. This theory allows arbitrary compositions of these operations to be straightforwardly analyzed, providing a very flexible framework covering the double bootstrap algorithm as a special case. Finally, we establish the long-term numerical stability of the double bootstrap algorithm by bounding its asymptotic variance under weak and easily checked assumptions satisfied typically for models with non-compact state space.

861,"A variety of problems in computing, service, and manufacturing systems can be modeled via infinite repeating Markov chains with an infinite number of levels and a finite number of phases. Many such chains are quasi-birth-death processes with transitions that are skip-free in level, in that one can only transition between consecutive levels, and unidirectional in phase, in that one can only transition from lower-numbered phases to higher-numbered phases. We present a procedure, which we call Clearing Analysis on Phases (CAP), for determining the limiting probabilities of such Markov chains exactly. The CAP method yields the limiting probability of each state in the repeating portion of the chain as a linear combination of scalar bases raised to a power corresponding to the level of the state. The weights in these linear combinations can be determined by solving a finite system of linear equations.

862,"An asymptotic framework for optimal control of multiclass stochastic processing networks, using formal diffusion approximations under suitable temporal and spatial scaling, by Brownian control problems (BCP) and their equivalent workload formulations (EWF), has been developed by Harrison (1988). This framework has been implemented in many works for constructing asymptotically optimal control policies for a broad range of stochastic network models. To date all asymptotic optimality results for such networks correspond to settings where the solution of the EWF is a reflected Brownian motion in ℝ+ or a wedge in ℝ+2. In this work we consider a well studied stochastic network which is perhaps the simplest example of a model with more than one dimensional workload process. In the regime considered here, the singular control problem corresponding to the EWF does not have a simple form explicit solution. However, by considering an associated free boundary problem one can give a representation for an optimal controlled process as a two dimensional reflected Brownian motion in a Lipschitz domain whose boundary is determined by the solution of the free boundary problem. Using the form of the optimal solution we propose a sequence of control policies, given in terms of suitable thresholds, for the scaled stochastic network control problems and prove that this sequence of policies is asymptotically optimal. As suggested by the solution of the EWF, the policy we propose requires a server to idle under certain conditions which are specified in terms of thresholds determined from the free boundary.

863,"We study a fork-join network with a single class of jobs, which are forked into a fixed number of parallel tasks upon arrival to be processed at the corresponding multi-server stations. After service completion, each task will join a buffer associated with the service station waiting for synchronization, called “unsynchronized queue”. The synchronization rule requires that all tasks from the same job must be completed, referred to as “non-exchangeable synchronization”. Once synchronized, jobs will leave the system immediately. Service times of the parallel tasks of each job can be correlated and form a sequence of i.i.d. random vectors with a general continuous joint distribution function. We study the joint dynamics of the queueing and service processes at all stations and the associated unsynchronized queueing processes.The main mathematical challenge lies in the “resequencing” of arrival orders after service completion at each station. As in Lu and Pang (2015) for the infinite-server fork-join network model, the dynamics of all the aforementioned processes can be represented via a multiparameter sequential empirical process driven by the service vectors for the parallel tasks of each job. We consider the system in the Halfin-Whitt regime, and prove a functional law of large number and a functional central limit theorem for queueing and synchronization processes. In this regime, although the delay for service at each station is asymptotically negligible, the delay for synchronization is of the same order as the service times.

864,"This paper studies the effect of an overdispersed arrival process on the performance of an infinite-server system. In our setup, a random environment is modeled by drawing an arrival rate Λ from a given distribution every Δ time units, yielding an i.i.d. sequence of arrival rates Λ1,Λ2, …. Applying a martingale central limit theorem, we obtain a functional central limit theorem for the scaled queue length process. We proceed to large deviations and derive the logarithmic asymptotics of the queue length’s tail probabilities. As it turns out, in a rapidly changing environment (i.e., Δ is small relative to Λ) the overdispersion of the arrival process hardly affects system behavior, whereas in a slowly changing random environment it is fundamentally different; this general finding applies to both the central limit and the large deviations regime. We extend our results to the setting where each arrival creates a job in multiple infinite-server queues.

865,"Brownian motion in R2+ with covariance matrix Σ and drift μ in the interior and reflection matrix R from the axes is considered. The asymptotic expansion of the stationary distribution density along all paths in R2+ is found and its main term is identified depending on parameters (Σ, μ, R). For this purpose the analytic approach of Fayolle, Iasnogorodski and Malyshev in [12] and [36], restricted essentially up to now to discrete random walks in Z2+ with jumps to the nearest-neighbors in the interior is developed in this article for diffusion processes on R2+ with reflections on the axes.

The DDS is a dynamic signal that is characterized by a continuous time constant (CST) and a continuous time constant (CST-CST) that is a continuous time constant.

866,"To understand the performance of a queueing system, it can be useful to focus on the evolution of the content that is initially in service at some time. That necessarily will be the case in service systems that provide service during normal working hours each day, with the system shutting down at some time, except that all customers already in service at the termination time are allowed to complete their service. Also, for infinite-server queues, it is often fruitful to partition the content into the initial content and the new input, because these can be analyzed separately. With i.i.d service times having a non-exponential distribution, the state of the initial content can be described by specifying the elapsed service times of the remaining initial customers. That initial content process is then a Markov process. This paper establishes a many-server heavy-traffic (MSHT) functional central limit theorem (FCLT) for the initial content process in the space 𝔻𝔻, assuming a FCLT for the initial age process, with the number of customers initially in service growing in the limit. The proof applies a symmetrization lemma from the literature on empirical processes to address a technical challenge: For each time, including time 0, the conditional remaining service times, given the ages, are mutually independent but in general not identically distributed.

867,"In the seminal paper of Gamarnik and Zeevi [17], the authors justify the steady-state diffusion approximation of a generalized Jackson network (GJN) in heavy traffic. Their approach involves the so-called limit interchange argument, which has since become a popular tool employed by many others who study diffusion approximations. In this paper we illustrate a novel approach by using it to justify the steady-state approximation of a GJN in heavy traffic. Our approach involves working directly with the basic adjoint relationship (BAR), an integral equation that characterizes the stationary distribution of a Markov process. As we will show, the BAR approach is a more natural choice than the limit interchange approach for justifying steady-state approximations, and can potentially be applied to the study of other stochastic processing networks such as multiclass queueing networks.

868,"Envisaging a physical queue of humans, we model a long queue by a continuous-space model in which, when a customer moves forward, they stop a random distance behind the previous customer, but do not move at all if their distance behind the previous customer is below a threshold. The latter assumption leads to “waves” of motion in which only some random number W of customers move. We prove that ℙ(W > k) decreases as order k− 1/2; in other words, for large k the k’th customer moves on average only once every order k1/2 service times. A more refined analysis relies on a non-obvious asymptotic relation to the coalescing Brownian motion process; we give a careful outline of such an analysis without attending to all the technical details.

869,"We consider a stochastic model for a blood bank, in which amounts of blood are offered and demanded according to independent compound Poisson processes. Blood is perishable, i.e., blood can only be kept in storage for a limited amount of time. Furthermore, demand for blood is impatient, i.e., a demand for blood may be canceled if it cannot be satisfied soon enough. For a range of perishability functions and demand impatience functions, we derive the steady-state distributions of the amount of blood kept in storage, and of the amount of demand for blood (at any point in time, at most one of these quantities is positive). Under certain conditions we also obtain the fluid and diffusion limits of the blood inventory process, showing in particular that the diffusion limit process is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

870,"A Markovian queueing network is considered with d independent customer classes and d server pools in Halfin–Whitt regime. Class i customers has priority for service in pool i for i = 1, …, d, and may access some other pool if the pool has an idle server and all the servers in pool i are busy. We formulate an ergodic control problem where the running cost is given by a non-negative convex function with polynomial growth. We show that the limiting controlled diffusion is modelled by an action space which depends on the state variable. We provide a complete analysis for the limiting ergodic control problem and establish asymptotic convergence of the value functions for the queueing model.

871,"We devise a Monte Carlo based method for detecting whether a non-negative Markov chain is stable for a given set of parameter values. More precisely, for a given subset of the parameter space, we develop an algorithm that is capable of deciding whether the set has a subset of positive Lebesgue measure for which the Markov chain is unstable. The approach is based on a variant of simulated annealing, and consequently only mild assumptions are needed to obtain performance guarantees.The theoretical underpinnings of our algorithm are based on a result stating that the stability of a set of parameters can be phrased in terms of the stability of a single Markov chain that searches the set for unstable parameters. Our framework leads to a procedure that is capable of performing statistically rigorous tests for instability, which has been extensively tested using several examples of standard and non-standard queueing networks.

872,"We consider Markovian many-server systems with admission control operating in a Quality-and-Efficiency-Driven (QED) regime, where the relative utilization approaches unity while the number of servers grows large, providing natural Economies-of-Scale. In order to determine the optimal admission control policy, we adopt a revenue maximization framework, and suppose that the revenue rate attains a maximum when no customers are waiting and no servers are idling. When the revenue function scales properly with the system size, we show that a nondegenerate optimization problem arises in the limit. Detailed analysis demonstrates that the revenue is maximized by nontrivial policies that bar customers from entering when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold of the order of the typical square-root level variation in the system occupancy. We identify a fundamental equation characterizing the optimal threshold, which we extensively leverage to provide broadly applicable upper/lower bounds for the optimal threshold, establish its monotonicity, and examine its asymptotic behavior, all for general revenue structures. For linear and exponential revenue structures, we present explicit expressions for the optimal threshold.

873,"We consider the following Markovian dynamic on point processes: at constant rate and with equal probability, either the rightmost atom of the current configuration is removed, or a new atom is added at a random distance from the rightmost atom. Interpreting atoms as limit buy orders, this process was introduced by Lakner et al. [Lakner et al. (2016) High frequency asymptotics for the limit order book. Mark. Microstructure Liq. 2:1650004 [83 pages]] to model a one-sided limit order book.We consider this model in the regime where the total number of orders converges to a reflected Brownian motion, and complement the results of Lakner et al. [Lakner P, Reed J, Stoikov S (2016) High frequency asymptotics for the limit order book. Mark. Microstructure Liq. 2:1650004 [83 pages]] by showing that, in the case where the mean displacement at which a new order is added is positive, the measure-valued process describing the whole limit order book converges to a simple functional of this reflected Brownian motion. Our results make it possible to derive useful and explicit approximations on various quantities of interest such as the depth or the total value of the book.Our approach leverages an unexpected connection with Lévy trees. More precisely, the cornerstone of our approach is the regenerative characterization of Lévy trees due to Weill [Weill M (2007) Regenerative real trees. Ann. Probab. 35:2091–2121. MR2353384 (2008j:60205)], which provides an elegant proof strategy which we unfold.

875,"This paper analyses the mixture of two continuous-time Markov chains with absorption on the same state space moving at different speeds, where the mixture occurs at a random time. Variety of associated distributional properties of the Markov mixture process are discussed, for example the transition matrix, the distribution of its lifetime and the corresponding forward intensity. Identities are given explicitly in terms of the Bayesian updates of switching probability and the intensity matrices of the underlying Markov chains despite the fact that the mixture process is not Markovian. They form nonstationary functions of time and duration and have two appealing features: the ability to capture heterogeneity and path dependence when conditioning on the available information (either full or partial) about the past history of the process until current time. In particular, the unconditional lifetime distribution forms a generalized mixture of phase-type distributions. The distribution has dense and closure properties under finite convex mixtures and finite convolutions. When the underlying Markov chains move at the same speed, in which case the mixture process reduces to a simple Markov chain, the heterogeneity and path dependence are removed, and the lifetime has the usual phase-type distribution, Neuts [Neuts MF (1975) Probability distributions of phase-type. Liber Amicorum Prof. Emiritus H. Florin (University of Louvain, Belgium), 173–206]. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the main results.

876,"We consider the following distributed service model: jobs with unit mean, exponentially distributed, and independent processing times arrive as a Poisson process of rate λn, with 0 < λ < 1, and are immediately dispatched by a centralized dispatcher to one of n First-In-First-Out queues associated with n identical servers. The dispatcher is endowed with a finite memory, and with the ability to exchange messages with the servers.We propose and study a resource-constrained “pull-based” dispatching policy that involves two parameters: (i) the number of memory bits available at the dispatcher, and (ii) the average rate at which servers communicate with the dispatcher. We establish (using a fluid limit approach) that the asymptotic, as n → ∞, expected queueing delay is zero when either (i) the number of memory bits grows logarithmically with n and the message rate grows superlinearly with n, or (ii) the number of memory bits grows superlogarithmically with n and the message rate is at least λn. Furthermore, when the number of memory bits grows only logarithmically with n and the message rate is proportional to n, we obtain a closed-form expression for the (now positive) asymptotic delay.Finally, we demonstrate an interesting phase transition in the resource-constrained regime where the asymptotic delay is non-zero. In particular, we show that for any given α > 0 (no matter how small), if our policy only uses a linear message rate αn, the resulting asymptotic delay is upper bounded, uniformly over all λ < 1; this is in sharp contrast to the delay obtained when no messages are used (α = 0), which grows as 1/(1 − λ) when λ ↑ 1, or when the popular power-of-d-choices is used, in which the delay grows as log(1/(1 − λ)).

877,"The goal of the paper is to evaluate the miss probability of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache, when it is offered a non-stationary request process given by a Poisson cluster point process. First, we construct a probability space using Palm theory, describing how to consider a tagged document with respect to the rest of the request process. This framework allows us to derive a fundamental integral formula for the expected number of misses of the tagged document. Then, we consider the limit when the cache size and the arrival rate go to infinity in proportion, and use the integral formula to derive an asymptotic expansion of the miss probability in powers of the inverse of the cache size. This enables us to quantify and improve the accuracy of the so-called Che approximation.

878,"A machine repair model under general operating/repair distributions is considered in the Quality-and-Efficiency Driven asymptotic (QED) regime: both the number of machines and the number of repairmen are large, while the capacity and offered load relate via the square-root staffing rule. Process-level convergence of the number of broken machines is established—the limit is in terms of the corresponding tractable infinite-repairmen process, a stationary centered Gaussian process.

879,"Mean-field models have been used to study large-scale and complex stochastic systems, such as large-scale data centers and dense wireless networks, using simple deterministic models (dynamical systems). This paper analyzes the approximation error of mean-field models for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) and focuses on mean-field models that are represented as finite-dimensional dynamical systems with a unique equilibrium point. By applying Stein’s method and the perturbation theory, the paper shows that under some mild conditions, if the mean-field model is globally asymptotically stable and locally exponentially stable, the mean-square difference between the stationary distribution of the stochastic system of size M (i.e., with M nodes/particles) and the equilibrium point of the corresponding mean-field system is O(1/M). The result of this paper establishes a general theorem for establishing the convergence and the approximation error (i.e., the rate of convergence) of a large class of CTMCs to their mean-field limits by mainly looking into the stability of the mean-field model, which is a deterministic system and is often easier to analyze than the CTMCs. Two applications of mean-field models in data center networks are presented to demonstrate the novelty of our results.

880,"Heavy-traffic limits are established for the stationary departure process from a GI/GI/1 queue and its variance function. The limit process is a function of the Brownian motion limits of the arrival and service processes plus the stationary reflected Brownian motion (RBM) limit of the queue-length process. An explicit expression is given for the variance function, which depends only on the first two moments of the interarrival times and service times plus the previously determined correlation function of canonical (drift −1, diffusion coefficient 1) RBM. The limit for the variance function here is used to show that the approximation for the index of dispersion for counts of the departure process used in our new robust queueing network analyzer is asymptotically correct in the heavy-traffic limit.

881,"This paper considers optimization over multiple renewal systems coupled by time-average constraints. These systems act asynchronously over variable length frames. When a particular system starts a new renewal frame, it chooses an action from a set of options for that frame. The action determines the duration of the frame, the penalty incurred during the frame (such as energy expenditure), and a vector of performance metrics (such as instantaneous number of job services). The goal is to minimize the time-average penalty subject to time-average overall constraints on the corresponding metrics. This problem has applications to task processing networks and coupled Markov decision processes. We propose a new algorithm so that each system can make its own decision after observing a global multiplier that is updated every slot. We show that this algorithm satisfies the desired constraints and achieves O(ϵ) near optimality with O(1/ϵ2) convergence time.

882,"Many stochastic systems have arrival processes that exhibit clustering behavior. In these systems, arriving entities influence additional arrivals to occur through self-excitation of the arrival process. In this paper, we analyze an infinite server queueing system in which the arrivals are driven by the self-exciting Hawkes process and in which service follows a phase-type distribution or is deterministic. In the phase-type setting, we derive differential equations for the moments and a partial differential equation for the moment-generating function; we also derive exact expressions for the transient and steady-state mean, variance, and covariances. Furthermore, we also derive exact expressions for the autocovariance of the queue and provide an expression for the cumulant moment–generating function in terms of a single ordinary differential equation. In the deterministic service setting, we provide exact expressions for the first and second moments and the queue autocovariance. As motivation for our Hawkes queueing model, we demonstrate its usefulness through two novel applications. These applications are trending internet traffic and arrivals to nightclubs. In the web traffic setting, we investigate the impact of a click. In the nightclub or club queue setting, we design an optimal control problem for the optimal rate to admit club-goers.

883,"We study the problem of staffing (specifying a time-varying number of servers) and scheduling (assigning newly idle servers to a waiting customer from one of K classes) in the many-server V model with class-dependent time-varying arrival rates. In order to stabilize performance at class-dependent delay targets, we propose the blind (model-free) head-of-line delay-ratio (HLDR) scheduling rule, which extends an earlier dynamic-priority rule that exploits the head-of-line delay information. We study the HLDR rule in the quality-and-efficiency-driven many-server heavy-traffic (MSHT) regime. We staff to the MSHT fluid limit plus a control function in the diffusion scale. We establish a MSHT limit for the Markov model, which has dramatic state-space collapse, showing that the targeted ratios are attained asymptotically. In the MSHT limit, meeting staffing goals reduces to a one-dimensional control problem for the aggregate queue content, which may be approximated by recently developed staffing algorithms for time-varying single-class models. Simulation experiments confirm that the overall procedure can be effective, even for non-Markov models.The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/stsy.2018.0015.

884,"We consider a system of N parallel single-server queues with unit exponential service rates and a single dispatcher where tasks arrive as a Poisson process of rate λ(N). When a task arrives, the dispatcher assigns it to a server with the shortest queue among d(N) randomly selected servers (1≤d(N)≤N). This load balancing strategy is referred to as a JSQ(d(N)) scheme, noting that it subsumes the celebrated Join-the-Shortest Queue (JSQ) policy as a crucial special case for d(N)=N. We construct a stochastic coupling to bound the difference in the queue length processes between the JSQ policy and a JSQ(d(N)) scheme with an arbitrary value of d(N). We use the coupling to derive the fluid limit in the regime where λ(N)/N→λ<1 as N→∞ with d(N)→∞, along with the associated fixed point. The fluid limit turns out not to depend on the exact growth rate of d(N) and in particular coincides with that for the JSQ policy. We further leverage the coupling to establish that the diffusion limit in the critical regime where (N−λ(N))/N→β>0 as N→∞ with d(N)/(Nlog(N))→∞ corresponds to that for the JSQ policy. These results indicate that the optimality of the JSQ policy can be preserved at the fluid level and diffusion level while reducing the overhead by nearly a factor O(N) and O(N/log(N)), respectively.

885,"The sequential stochastic assignment problem (SSAP) assigns sequentially arriving tasks with stochastic parameters (coming from a known distribution) to workers with fixed success rates so as to maximize the total expected reward. This paper studies the generalized SSAP (GSSAP), an extension of SSAP with no prior information on task values. GSSAP is described as a generalization of the secretary problem, in which the set of selected elements in the secretary problem are assigned to distinct positions in GSSAP. The weighted secretary problem is used to design two deterministic and one randomized algorithm for GSSAP. The proposed algorithms have a threshold structure: the first few stages of the problem are used as a training phase to compute thresholds. These thresholds are then used to assign tasks to workers after the training phase. These algorithms provide intuitive models to assign tasks arriving in the training phase to workers. Although the expected reward achieved by the deterministic algorithms has a better lower bound, the randomized algorithm provides fairness by assigning each task to any of the workers with equal probability.

886,"We study a model of competition among nomadic agents for time-varying and location-specific resources arising in crowdsourced transportation services, online communities, and traditional location-based economic activity. This model comprises a group of agents and a single location endowed with a dynamic stochastic resource process. Periodically, each agent derives a reward determined by the location’s resource level and the number of other agents there and has to decide whether to stay at the location or move. On moving, the agent arrives at a different location whose dynamics are independent of and identical to the original location. Using the methodology of mean field equilibrium, we study the equilibrium behavior of the agents as a function of the dynamics of the stochastic resource process and the nature of the competition among colocated agents. We show that an equilibrium exists in which each agent decides whether to switch locations based only on the agent’s current location’s resource level and the number of other agents there. We additionally show that when an agent’s payoff is decreasing in the number of other agents at the agent’s location, equilibrium strategies obey a simple threshold structure. We show how to exploit this structure to compute equilibria numerically and use these numerical techniques to study how system structure affects the agents’ collective ability to explore their domain to find and effectively utilize resource-rich areas.

888,"Given an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and its perturbation, the Alekseev formula expresses the solutions of the latter in terms related to the former. By exploiting this formula and a new concentration inequality for martingale-differences, we develop a novel approach for analyzing nonlinear stochastic approximation (SA). This approach is useful for studying a SA’s behavior close to a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium (LASE) of its limiting ODE; this LASE need not be the limiting ODE’s only attractor. As an application, we obtain a new concentration bound for nonlinear SA. That is, given ϵ > and that the current iterate is in a neighborhood of a LASE, we provide an estimate for (i) the time required to hit the ϵ-ball of this LASE, and (ii) the probability that after this time the iterates are indeed within this ϵ-ball and stay there thereafter. The latter estimate can also be viewed as the “lock-in” probability. Compared with related results, our concentration bound is tighter and holds under significantly weaker assumptions. In particular, our bound applies even when the stepsizes are not square-summable. Despite the weaker hypothesis, we show that the celebrated Kushner-Clark lemma continues to hold.

889,"We consider a service system with an infinite number of exponential servers sharing a finite service capacity. The servers are ordered by their speed, and arriving customers join the fastest idle server. A capacity allocation is an infinite sequence of service rates. We study the probabilistic properties of this system by considering overflows from subsystems with a finite number of servers. Several stability measures are suggested and analyzed. The tail of the series of service rates that minimizes the average expected delay (service time) is shown to be approximately geometrically decreasing. We use this property to approximate the optimal allocation of service rates by constructing an appropriate dynamic program.

890,"We consider a service system with two competing firms offering service via two different pricing and service rules. With the fixed price firm, customers obtain service at a fixed price and have homogeneous expected waiting times. With the bid-based firm, customers submit a bid to obtain service, incur expected waiting times decreasing in their bids, and make payments equal to their bids. We assume the customers are heterogeneous, with different waiting costs, and choose the firm from which to obtain service strategically on arrival. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a symmetric equilibrium for the customers’ decision problem for any given fixed and reserve price set by the two firms and characterize the structure of the resulting equilibrium strategy. In particular, we show that the customers’ equilibrium strategy has a simple threshold structure, where customers with either high or low waiting cost choose to obtain service from the bid-based firm, whereas those with moderate waiting cost choose to obtain service from the fixed price firm. We use this characterization of the equilibrium strategy to study the price competition between the two firms and show that there exists a mixed Nash equilibrium. Moreover, we analyze price and capacity competition between the firms in a limiting regime where the customer arrival rate and the service capacities increase proportionally and show that this competition inherently favors the bid-based firm.

892,"We consider a discrete-time Markov chain Φ on a general state-space X, whose transition probabilities are parameterized by a real-valued vector θ. Under the assumption that Φ is geometrically ergodic with corresponding stationary distribution π(θ), we are interested in using Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the gradient ∇α(θ) of the steady-state expectation α(θ) = π(θ) To this end, we first give sufficient conditions for the differentiability of α(θ) and for the calculation of its gradient via a sequence of finite horizon expectations. We then propose two different likelihood ratio estimators and analyze their limiting behavior.

893,"We develop an effective Monte Carlo method for estimating sensitivities or gradients of expectations of sufficiently smooth functionals of a reflected diffusion in a convex polyhedral domain with respect to its defining parameters, namely its initial condition, drift, and diffusion coefficients and directions of reflection. Our method, which falls into the class of infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) methods, uses a probabilistic representation for such sensitivities as the expectation of a functional of the reflected diffusion and its associated derivative process. The latter process is the unique solution to a constrained linear stochastic differential equation with jumps whose coefficients, domain, and directions of reflection are modulated by the reflected diffusion. We propose a consistent estimator for such sensitivities using an Euler approximation of the reflected diffusion and its associated derivative process. Proving that the Euler approximation converges is challenging because the derivative process jumps whenever the reflected diffusion hits the boundary of the domain. A key step in the proof is establishing a continuity property of the related derivative map, which is of independent interest. We compare the performance of our IPA estimator with a standard likelihood ratio estimator (whenever the latter is applicable) and provide numerical evidence that the variance of the former is substantially smaller than that of the latter. We illustrate our method with an example of a rank-based interacting diffusion model of equity markets. Interestingly, we show that estimating certain sensitivities of the rank-based interacting diffusion model using our method for a reflected Brownian motion description of the model outperforms a finite difference method for a stochastic differential equation description of the model.

894,"Multiclass queueing networks (McQNs) extend the classical concept of the Jackson network by allowing jobs of different classes to visit the same server. Although such a generalization seems rather natural, from a structural perspective, there is a significant gap between the two concepts. Nice analytical features of Jackson networks, such as stability conditions, product–form equilibrium distributions, and stochastic monotonicity, do not immediately carry over to the multiclass framework. The aim of this paper is to shed some light on this structural gap, focusing on monotonicity properties. To this end, we introduce and study a class of Markov processes, which we call Q-processes, modeling the time evolution of the network configuration of any open, work-conservative McQN having exponential service times and Poisson input. We define a new monotonicity notion tailored for this class of processes. Our main result is that we show monotonicity for a large class of McQN models, covering virtually all instances of practical interest. This leads to interesting properties that are commonly encountered for “traditional” queueing processes, such as (i) monotonicity with respect to external arrival rates and (ii) star-convexity of the stability region (with respect to the external arrival rates); such properties are well known for Jackson networks but had not been established at this level of generality. This research was partly motivated by the recent development of a simulation-based method that allows one to numerically determine the stability region of a McQN parameterized in terms of the arrival-rates vector.

895,"We study multiclass many-server queues for which the arrival, service, and abandonment rates are all modulated by a common finite-state Markov process. We assume that the system operates in the “averaged” Halfin–Whitt regime, which means that it is critically loaded in the average sense although not necessarily in each state of the Markov process. We show that, under any static priority policy, the Markov-modulated diffusion-scaled queueing process is exponentially ergodic. This is accomplished by employing a solution to an associated Poisson equation to construct a suitable Lyapunov function. We establish a functional central limit theorem for the diffusion-scaled queueing process and show that the limiting process is a controlled diffusion with piecewise linear drift and constant covariance matrix. We address the infinite-horizon discounted and long-run average (ergodic) optimal control problems and establish asymptotic optimality.

896,"This paper provides a mathematical framework for estimation of the service time distribution and expected service time of an infinite-server queueing system with a nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival process in the case of partial information, where only the numbers of busy servers are observed over time. The problem is reduced to a statistical deconvolution problem, which is solved by using Laplace transform techniques and kernels for regularization. Upper bounds on the mean squared error of the proposed estimators are derived. Some concrete simulation experiments are performed to illustrate how the method can be applied and provide some insight in the practical performance.

The results show that the method performs well in the presence of stochastic demand.  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \,-0.9583229,1.528039,0.32801896,0.82135224,-0.3346411,0.893567,0.2166456,-0.43992862,0.8798615,1.0388569,0.49358898,-0.5255555,-1.2291412,0.9541054,1.2990197,-0.31734148,0.71648455,1.33042,0.03306734,-1.3121898,-0.38753298,0.4235103,0.24471289,1.0011598,-1.0951183,0.6992884,0.114886224,-1.4021908,-1.8825483,-0.99341136,-1.6281344,0.9365695,0.5338801,0.43932125,1.0098267,1.2201278,-0.22405633,-0.21977502,0.3470677,-0.0042708376,-1.1274514,-0.65474874,2.1513608,0.50865537,0.6646362,0.9745399,1.6176193,-0.9699883,-0.20268764,-1.7572265,-0.4744357,0.546402,-0.8556133,-1.0909736,0.21100587,-1.9482754,-0.34430668,0.8055573,-0.14907059,-0.44249722,0.6903379,-0.36792266,-0.39085352,0.24282125,-0.8839823,-0.15073544,-0.99615455,-0.10199529,0.4364586,-0.054809995,-0.032197397,0.79019547,-1.490471,-0.19914429,-0.5412135,0.239027,-0.28607163,0.5968041,2.1298625,-0.33196098,2.4242954,-1.0954615,-0.95664203,-0.14996965,0.8588483,-1.0570608,-0.930693,-0.6070977,-0.10373364,0.46672237,-0.21334912,0.16929395,-1.1688333,0.78352875,0.53093225,0.33760795,0.85379237,-0.96386987,-0.77576137,-0.47975335,-0.49473718,0.22267556,-0.399327,0.38168418,0.5647857,-0.42098725,-0.6037477,1.5796312,0.85308903,-0.7405836,0.3057296,0.20425345,-0.98558605,-0.22231883,-0.038004767,0.6615621,1.4183054,-0.70497775,-0.71223617,-0.3670847,-0.44425616,-0.38627747,1.1092657,1.1639289,-0.03422449,-0.39945963,0.42230964,0.620754
897,"In this paper, we study the asymptotics of the (scaled) exceedance probability of a multitimescale doubly-stochastic Lévy process. Two timescale regimes are distinguished: a fast regime in which one of the timescales is superlinear and a slow regime in which it is sublinear. We provide the exact asymptotics of the exceedance probability for both regimes, relying on change-of-measure arguments in combination with Edgeworth-type estimates. The asymptotics have an unconventional form: the exponent contains the commonly observed linear term but may also contain sublinear terms (the number of which depends on the precise form of the timescales chosen). To showcase the power of our results, we include two examples covering the cases where the multitimescale Lévy process is lattice and nonlattice. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the importance of taking into account the doubly stochastic nature in a practical application related to customer streams in service systems. They show that the asymptotic results obtained yield highly accurate approximations also in scenarios in which there is no pronounced timescale separation.

898,"In the secretary problem of Cayley [Cayley A (1875) Mathematical questions with their solutions. Ed. Times 23:18–19.] and Moser [Moser L (1956) On a problem of Cayley. Scripta Mathematica 22(3/4):289–292.], n nonnegative, independent, random variables with common distribution are sequentially presented to a decision maker who decides when to stop and collect the most recent realization. The goal is to maximize the expected value of the collected element. In the k-choice variant, the decision maker is allowed to make k ≤ n selections to maximize the expected total value of the selected elements. Assuming that the values are drawn from a known distribution with finite support, we prove that the best regret—the expected gap between the optimal online policy and its offline counterpart in which all n values are made visible at time 0—is uniformly bounded in the number of candidates n and the budget k. Our proof is constructive: we develop an adaptive budget-ratio policy that achieves this performance. The policy selects or skips values depending on where the ratio of the residual budget to the remaining time stands relative to multiple thresholds that correspond to middle points of the distribution. We also prove that being adaptive is crucial: in general, the minimal regret among nonadaptive policies grows like the square root of n. The difference is the value of adaptiveness.

899,"We consider a single-server queue with unlimited waiting space, the first-come, first-served discipline, a periodic arrival-rate function, and independent and identically distributed service requirements, where the service-rate function is subject to control. We previously showed that a rate-matching control, whereby the service rate is made proportional to the arrival rate, stabilizes the queue-length process but not the (virtual) waiting-time process. To minimize the maximum expected waiting time (and stabilize the expected waiting time), we now consider a modification of the service-rate control involving two parameters: a time lag and a damping factor. We develop an efficient simulation search algorithm to find the best time lag and damping factor. That simulation algorithm is an extension of our recent rare-event simulation algorithm for the GIt/GI/1 queue to the GIt/GIt/1 queue, allowing the time-varying service rate. To gain insight into these controls, we establish a heavy-traffic limit with periodicity in the fluid scale. This produces a diffusion control problem for the stabilization, which we solve numerically by the simulation search in the scaled family of systems with ρ ↑ 1. The state space collapse in that theorem shows that there is a time-varying Little’s law in heavy traffic, implying that the queue length and waiting time cannot be simultaneously stabilized in this limit. We conduct simulation experiments showing that the new control is effective for stabilizing the expected waiting time for a wide range of model parameters, but we also show that it cannot stabilize the expected waiting time perfectly.

901,"The relative value iteration scheme (RVI) for Markov decision processes (MDP) dates back to White (1963), a seminal work, which introduced an algorithm for solving the ergodic dynamic programming equation for the finite state, finite action case. Its ramifications have given rise to popular learning algorithms (Q-learning). More recently, this algorithm gained prominence because of its implications for model predictive control (MPC). For stochastic control problems on an infinite time horizon, especially for problems that seek to optimize the average performance (ergodic control), obtaining the optimal policy in explicit form is only possible for a few classes of well-structured models. What is often used in practice is a heuristic method called the rolling horizon, or receding horizon, or MPC. This works as follows: one solves the finite horizon problem for a given number of steps N, or for an interval [0,T] in the case of a continuous time problem. The result is a nonstationary Markov policy, which is optimal for the finite horizon problem. We fix the initial action (this is the action determined at the Nth step of the value iteration (VI) algorithm) and apply it as a stationary Markov control. We refer to this Markov control as the rolling horizon control. This of course depends on the length of the horizon N. One expects that for well-structured problems, if N is sufficiently large, then the rolling horizon control is near optimal. Of course, this is a heuristic. The rolling horizon control might not even be stable. For a good discussion on this problem, we refer the reader to Della Vecchia et al. (2012). Obtaining such solutions is further complicated by the fact that the value of the ergodic cost required in the successive iteration scheme is not known. This is the reason for the RVI.

902,"For queueing systems, leveraging knowledge of job sizes to perform size-based scheduling leads to policies with attractive performance characteristics. Although there is a body of literature in this area, in the interest of space, we highlight one classical result: for a single-server system, the shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) policy (priority is given to the job closest to completion) is known to minimize the mean response time (Schrage and Miller 1966). Although this and related performance results have been known for some time, such size-based scheduling policies have not been deployed to any great extent in practice. One objection to their deployment is that the assumption that one knows job sizes exactly is problematic; the typical scenario would be that estimates of job sizes are available to make scheduling decisions. There is not a large literature on the study of queueing systems in which there are estimation errors for job sizes. In the next paragraph, we discuss some typical approaches and then conclude the section with two open problems of interest in this area.

903,"The shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) scheduling policy has been deployed in many computer systems, such as web servers (Harchol-Balter et al. 2003), networks (Montazeri et al. 2018), databases (Guirguis et al. 2009), and operating systems (Bunt 1976). SRPT has also received extensive study by queueing theorists. In 1966, the mean response time for SRPT was first derived (Schrage and Miller 1966), and in 1968, SRPT was shown to minimize mean response time (Schrage 1968). However, these results are only known for single-server systems. Much less is known for multiserver systems, such as the M/G/k.

904,"Central limit theorems represent among the most celebrated of limit theorems in probability theory (Lindeberg 1922, Feller 1945). It may be recalled that the sum of n independent and identically distributed zero mean square integrable random variables grows at the rate of n. Consequently, by dividing this sum by n, we expect its law to possibly approach a limit. This intuition is formalized by the central limit theorem (CLT; Chow and Teicher 2012, chapter 9), and in fact, this limit is the normal distribution. Our interest lies in developing limiting statements for estimators to the following stochastic optimization problem:minx∈Rnf(x)=ΔE[F(x,ξ)], (SOpt)where f(x) is a strongly convex function on Rn, F : Rn × Rd → R is a real-valued function, E : Ω → Rd, and (Ω,F,P) denotes the associated probability space.

906,"Load-balancing algorithms are important for efficiently routing jobs in systems of parallel queues; however, there has been relatively little attention devoted to developing algorithms in the presence of messaging and/or routing delays. Given a system of parallel queues with infinite capacity buffers; first-come, first-serve service discipline; and a single stream of incoming jobs that are routed by a dispatcher upon arrival, it has been shown that join the shortest queue (JSQ) satisfies certain optimality properties, including minimizing mean wait time when the job sizes are exponentially distributed (Winston 1977, Ephremides et al. 1980) and state space collapse of the queue lengths under heavy traffic scaling for general service distributions (Reiman 1984). However, implementation of JSQ uses up-to-date information about the state of the buffers, which requires instantaneous exchange of multiple messages between the dispatcher and the queues. This challenge has led to the development of efficient algorithms that require fewer messages, including join the shortest of d queues (JSQ(d); Vvedenskaya et al. 1996, Mitzenmacher 2001), join the idle queue (JIQ; Badonnel and Burgess 2008, Lu et al. 2011), and persistent idle load distribution (PILD; Atar et al. 2019a, b); see van der Boor et al. (2018) for a survey of some recent results in the many-server limit. Although these algorithms do not use full information about the system, they still use up-to-date information about the state of some of the queues. Because of the physical separation between the dispatcher and the queues, processing effects, or periodic updates from the queues, the dispatcher may have access only to information about the delayed states of the queues. (There may also be routing delays because of the time it takes a job to travel between the dispatcher and its assigned server, for which these algorithms also do not account.) In such settings, it has been shown that JSQ can perform quite poorly and lead to sustained oscillations in queue lengths (Mitzenmacher 2000).

908,"The problem of preemptively scheduling jobs in the M/G/1 queue to minimize mean response time is a classic problem in computer systems. Typically, one assumes that the time it takes to preempt a job is negligible, in which case the shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) policy is optimal when job sizes are known (Schrage 1968), and the Gittins index (GI) policy is optimal when job sizes are unknown (von Olivier 1972, Gittins et al. 2011).

909,"We study the many-server queue shown in Figure 1(a). Customers from class j ∈ {1, 2} arrive according to renewal processes having rate λj > 0 and request processing. There are N ∈ {1, 2,…} servers, each working at rate one. All servers are fully flexible; that is, every server can serve customers from both classes. Each customer has a randomly distributed patience time that may depend on the class and reneges (abandons the system without receiving service) if service does not begin before the patience time expires. The system incurs the penalty p1 > 0 when a class 1 customer reneges and the penalty p2 > 0 when a class 2 customer reneges. Upon arrival, each class j customer independently samples from the distribution determined by cumulative distribution function (cdf) Gjr having mean 1/θj < ∞ to find its patience time and from the distribution determined by cdf Gjs having mean 1/μj < ∞ to determine its service time (that is, the required processing time).

911,"In a multi-armed bandit problem, a gambler needs to choose at each round one of K arms, each characterized by an unknown reward distribution. The objective is to maximize cumulative expected earnings over a planning horizon of length T, and performance is measured in terms of regret relative to a (static) oracle that knows the identity of the best arm a priori. This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time, and uncertainty essentially amounts to identifying the optimal arm. We complement this literature by developing a flexible non-parametric model for temporal uncertainty in the rewards. The extent of temporal uncertainty is measured via the cumulative mean change in the rewards over the horizon, a metric we refer to as temporal variation, and regret is measured relative to a (dynamic) oracle that plays the point-wise optimal action at each period. Assuming that nature can choose any sequence of mean rewards such that their temporal variation does not exceed V (a temporal uncertainty budget), we characterize the complexity of this problem via the minimax regret, which depends on V (the hardness of the problem), the horizon length T, and the number of arms K.

912,"We consider the model of a token-based joint autoscaling and load-balancing strategy, proposed in a recent paper by Mukherjee et al. [Mukherjee D, Dhara S, Borst SC, Van Leeuwaarden JSH (2017) Optimal service elasticity in large-scale distributed systems. Proc. ACM Measurement Anal. Comput. Systems 1(1):25:1–25:28.], which offers an efficient scalable implementation and yet achieves asymptotically optimal steady-state delay performance and energy consumption as the number of servers N → ∞. In the aforementioned work, the asymptotic results are obtained under the assumption that the queues have fixed-size finite buffers, and therefore, the fundamental question of stability of the proposed scheme with infinite buffers was left open. In this paper, we address this fundamental stability question. The system stability under the usual subcritical load assumption is not automatic. Moreover, the stability may not even hold for all N. The key challenge stems from the fact that the process lacks monotonicity, which has been the powerful primary tool for establishing stability in load-balancing models. We develop a novel method to prove that the subcritically loaded system is stable for large enough N and establish convergence of steady-state distributions to the optimal one as N → ∞. The method goes beyond the state-of-the-art techniques; it uses an induction-based idea and a “weak monotonicity” property of the model. This technique is of independent interest and may have broader applicability.

913,"We study a multiclass M/M/1 queueing control problem with finite buffers under heavy traffic in which the decision maker is uncertain about the rates of arrivals and service of the system and by scheduling and admission/rejection decisions acts to minimize a discounted cost that accounts for the uncertainty. The main result is the asymptotic optimality of a cμ type of policy derived via underlying stochastic differential games studied in Cohen [Cohen A (2018) Brownian control problems for a multiclass M/M/1 queueing problem with model uncertainty. Math. Oper. Res. 44(2):739–766.]. Under this policy, with high probability, rejections are not performed when the workload lies below some cutoff that depends on the ambiguity level. When the workload exceeds this cutoff, rejections are carried out and only from the buffer with the cheapest rejection cost weighted with the mean service rate. The allocation part of the policy is the same for all the ambiguity levels. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address a heavy-traffic queueing control problem with model uncertainty.

914,"Cascading failure models are typically used to capture the phenomenon where failures possibly trigger further failures in succession, causing knock-on effects. In many networks, this ultimately leads to a disintegrated network where the failure propagation continues independently across the various components. In order to gain insight into the impact of network splitting on cascading failure processes, we extend a well-established cascading failure model for which the number of failures obeys a power-law distribution. We assume that a single line failure immediately splits the network in two components and examine its effect on the power-law exponent. The results provide valuable qualitative insights that are crucial first steps toward understanding more complex network splitting scenarios.

916,"In a ride-sharing system, arriving customers must be matched with available drivers. These decisions affect the overall number of customers matched, because they impact whether future available drivers will be close to the locations of arriving customers. A common policy used in practice is the closest driver policy, which offers an arriving customer the closest driver. This is an attractive policy because it is simple and easy to implement. However, we expect that parameter-based policies can achieve better performance. We propose matching policies based on a continuous linear program (CLP) that accounts for (i) the differing arrival rates of customers and drivers in different areas of the city, (ii) how long customers are willing to wait for driver pickup, (iii) how long drivers are willing to wait for a customer, and (iv) the time-varying nature of all the aforementioned parameters. We prove asymptotic optimality of a forward-looking CLP-based policy in a large market regime and of a myopic linear program–based matching policy when drivers are fully utilized. When pricing affects customer and driver arrival rates and parameters are time homogeneous, we show that asymptotically optimal joint pricing and matching decisions lead to fully utilized drivers under mild conditions.

917,"We develop a comprehensive mathematical framework for polynomial jump diffusions in a semimartingale context, which nest affine jump diffusions and have broad applications in finance. We show that the polynomial property is preserved under polynomial transformations and Lévy time change. We present a generic method for option pricing based on moment expansions. As an application, we introduce a large class of novel financial asset pricing models with excess log returns that are conditional Lévy based on polynomial jump diffusions.

918,"We study shot noise processes when the shot noises are weakly dependent, satisfying the ρ-mixing condition. We prove a functional weak law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for this shot noise process in an asymptotic regime with a high intensity of shots. The deterministic fluid limit is unaffected by the presence of weak dependence. The limit in the diffusion scale is a continuous Gaussian process whose covariance function explicitly captures the dependence among the noises. The model and results can be applied in financial and insurance risks with dependent claims as well as queueing systems with dependent service times. To prove the existence of the limit process, we employ the existence criterion that uses a maximal inequality requiring a set function with a superadditivity property. We identify such a set function for the limit process by exploiting the ρ-mixing condition. To prove the weak convergence, we establish the tightness property and the convergence of finite dimensional distributions. To prove tightness, we construct two auxiliary processes and apply an Ottaviani-type inequality for weakly dependent sequences.

919,"Stochastic gradient descent in continuous time (SGDCT) provides a computationally efficient method for the statistical learning of continuous-time models, which are widely used in science, engineering, and finance. The SGDCT algorithm follows a (noisy) descent direction along a continuous stream of data. The parameter updates occur in continuous time and satisfy a stochastic differential equation. This paper analyzes the asymptotic convergence rate of the SGDCT algorithm by proving a central limit theorem for strongly convex objective functions and, under slightly stronger conditions, for nonconvex objective functions as well. An Lp convergence rate is also proven for the algorithm in the strongly convex case. The mathematical analysis lies at the intersection of stochastic analysis and statistical learning.

920,"A parallel server system is considered in which a dispatcher routes incoming jobs to a fixed number of heterogeneous servers, each with its own queue. Much effort has been previously made to design policies that use limited state information (e.g., the queue lengths in a small subset of the set of servers, or the identity of the idle servers). However, existing policies either do not achieve the stability region or perform poorly in terms of job completion time. We introduce Persistent-Idle (PI), a new, perhaps counterintuitive, load-distribution policy that is designed to work with limited state information. Roughly speaking, PI always routes to the server that has last been idle. Our main result is that this policy achieves the stability region. Because it operates quite differently from existing policies, our proof method differs from standard arguments in the literature. Specifically, large time properties of reflected random walk, along with a careful choice of a Lyapunov function, are combined to obtain a Lyapunov condition over sufficiently long-time intervals. We also provide simulation results that indicate that job completion times under PI are low for different choices of system parameters, compared with several state-of-the-art load-distribution schemes.

921,"We study a dynamic and stochastic knapsack problem in which a decision maker is sequentially presented with items arriving according to a Bernoulli process over n discrete time periods. Items have equal rewards and independent weights that are drawn from a known nonnegative continuous distribution F. The decision maker seeks to maximize the expected total reward of the items that the decision maker includes in the knapsack while satisfying a capacity constraint and while making terminal decisions as soon as each item weight is revealed. Under mild regularity conditions on the weight distribution F, we prove that the regret—the expected difference between the performance of the best sequential algorithm and that of a prophet who sees all of the weights before making any decision—is, at most, logarithmic in n. Our proof is constructive. We devise a reoptimized heuristic that achieves this regret bound.

922,"In this paper, we propose and analyze models of self policing in online communities, in which assessment activities, typically handled by firm employees, are shifted to the “crowd.” Our underlying objective is to maximize firm value by maintaining the quality of the online community to prevent attrition, which, given a parsimonious model of voter participation, we show can be achieved by efficiently utilizing the crowd of volunteer voters. To do so, we focus on minimizing the number of voters needed for each assessment, subject to service-level constraints, which depends on a voting aggregation rule. We focus our attention on classes of voting aggregators that are simple, interpretable, and implementable, which increases the chance of adoption in practice. We consider static and dynamic variants of simple majority-rule voting, with which each vote is treated equally. We also study static and dynamic variants of a more sophisticated voting rule that allows more accurate voters to have a larger influence in determining the aggregate decision. We consider both independent and correlated voters and show that correlation is detrimental to performance. Finally, we take a system view and characterize the limit of a costless crowdvoting system that relies solely on volunteer voters. If this limit does not satisfy target service levels, then costly firm employees are needed to supplement the crowd.

923,"We consider a multihop switched network operating under a max-weight scheduling policy and show that the distance between the queue length process and a fluid solution remains bounded by a constant multiple of the deviation of the cumulative arrival process from its average. We then exploit this result to prove matching upper and lower bounds for the time scale over which additive state space collapse (SSC) takes place. This implies, as two special cases, an additive SSC result in diffusion scaling under non-Markovian arrivals and, for the case of independent and identically distributed arrivals, an additive SSC result over an exponential time scale.

924,"This work concerns the asymptotic behavior of solutions to a (strictly) subcritical fluid model for a data communication network, where file sizes are generally distributed and the network operates under a fair bandwidth-sharing policy. Here we consider fair bandwidth-sharing policies that are a slight generalization of the α-fair policies introduced by Mo and Walrand [Mo J, Walrand J (2000) Fair end-to-end window-based congestion control. IEEE/ACM Trans. Networks 8(5):556–567.]. Since the year 2000, it has been a standing problem to prove stability of the data communications network model of Massoulié and Roberts [Massoulié L, Roberts J (2000) Bandwidth sharing and admission control for elastic traffic. Telecommunication Systems 15(1):185–201.], with general file sizes and operating under fair bandwidth sharing policies, when the offered load is less than capacity (subcritical conditions). A crucial step in an approach to this problem is to prove stability of subcritical fluid model solutions. In 2012, Paganini et al. [Paganini F, Tang A, Ferragut A, Andrew LLH (2012) Network stability under alpha fair bandwidth allocation with general file size distribution. IEEE Trans. Automatic Control 57(3):579–591.] introduced a Lyapunov function for this purpose and gave an argument, assuming that fluid model solutions are sufficiently smooth in time and space that they are strong solutions of a partial differential equation and assuming that no fluid level on any route touches zero before all route levels reach zero. The aim of the current paper is to prove stability of the subcritical fluid model without these strong assumptions. Starting with a slight generalization of the Lyapunov function proposed by Paganini et al., assuming that each component of the initial state of a measure-valued fluid model solution, as well as the file size distributions, have no atoms and have finite first moments, we prove absolute continuity in time of the composition of the Lyapunov function with any subcritical fluid model solution and describe the associated density. We use this to prove that the Lyapunov function composed with such a subcritical fluid model solution converges to zero as time goes to infinity. This implies that each component of the measure-valued fluid model solution converges vaguely on (0, ∞) to the zero measure as time goes to infinity. Under the further assumption that the file size distributions have finite pth moments for some p > 1 and that each component of the initial state of the fluid model solution has finite pth moment, it is proved that the fluid model solution reaches the measure with all components equal to the zero measure in finite time and that the time to reach this zero state has a uniform bound for all fluid model solutions having a uniform bound on the initial total mass and the pth moment of each component of the initial state. In contrast to the analysis of Paganini et al., we do not need their strong smoothness assumptions on fluid model solutions and we rigorously treat the realistic, but singular situation, where the fluid level on some routes becomes zero, whereas other route levels remain positive.

925,"The drift method was recently developed to study queuing systems in steady state. It was used successfully to obtain bounds on the moments of the scaled queue lengths that are asymptotically tight in heavy traffic and in a wide variety of systems, including generalized switches, input-queued switches, bandwidth-sharing networks, and so on. In this paper, we develop the use of transform techniques for heavy-traffic analysis, with a special focus on the use of moment-generating functions. This approach simplifies the proofs of the drift method and provides a new perspective on the drift method. We present a general framework and then use the moment-generating function method to obtain the stationary distribution of scaled queue lengths in heavy traffic in queuing systems that satisfy the complete resource pooling condition. In particular, we study load balancing systems and generalized switches under general settings.

926,"We consider a queue to which only a finite pool of n customers can arrive, at times depending on their service requirement. A customer with stochastic service requirement S arrives to the queue after an exponentially distributed time with mean S-α for some α∈[0,1]; therefore, larger service requirements trigger customers to join earlier. This finite-pool queue interpolates between two previously studied cases: α = 0 gives the so-called Δ(i)/G/1 queue and α = 1 is closely related to the exploration process for inhomogeneous random graphs. We consider the asymptotic regime in which the pool size n grows to infinity and establish that the scaled queue-length process converges to a diffusion process with a negative quadratic drift. We leverage this asymptotic result to characterize the head start that is needed to create a long period of activity. We also describe how this first busy period of the queue gives rise to a critically connected random forest.

927,"Probability distributions over rankings are crucial for the modeling and design of a wide range of practical systems. In this work, we pursue a nonparametric approach that seeks to learn a distribution over rankings (aka the ranking model) that is consistent with the observed data and has the sparsest possible support (i.e., the smallest number of rankings with nonzero probability mass). We focus on first-order marginal data, which comprise information on the probability that item i is ranked at position j, for all possible item and position pairs. The observed data may be noisy. Finding the sparsest approximation requires brute force search in the worst case. To address this issue, we restrict our search to, what we dub, the signature family, and show that the sparsest model within the signature family can be found computationally efficiently compared with the brute force approach. We then establish that the signature family provides good approximations to popular ranking model classes, such as the multinomial logit and the exponential family classes, with support size that is small relative to the dimension of the observed data. We test our methods on two data sets: the ranked election data set from the American Psychological Association and the preference ordering data on 10 different sushi varieties.

928,"Testing multiple subjects within a group, with a single test applied to the group (i.e., group testing), is an important tool for classifying populations as positive or negative for a specific binary characteristic in an efficient manner. We study the design of easily implementable, static group testing schemes that take into account operational constraints, heterogeneous populations, and uncertainty in subject risk, while considering classification accuracy- and robustness-based objectives. We derive key structural properties of optimal risk-based designs and show that the problem can be formulated as network flow problems. Our reformulation involves computationally expensive high-dimensional integrals. We develop an analytical expression that eliminates the need to compute high-dimensional integrals, drastically improving the tractability of constructing the underlying network. We demonstrate the impact through a case study on chlamydia screening, which leads to the following insights: (1) Risk-based designs are shown to be less expensive, more accurate, and more robust than current practices. (2) The performance of static risk-based schemes comprised of only two group sizes is comparable to those comprised of many group sizes. (3) Static risk-based schemes are an effective alternative to more complicated dynamic schemes. (4) An expectation-based formulation captures almost all benefits of a static risk-based scheme.

929,"We propose a new simple and natural algorithm for learning the optimal Q-value function of a discounted-cost Markov decision process (MDP) when the transition kernels are unknown. Unlike the classical learning algorithms for MDPs, such as Q-learning and actor-critic algorithms, this algorithm does not depend on a stochastic approximation-based method. We show that our algorithm, which we call the empiricalQ-value iteration algorithm, converges to the optimal Q-value function. We also give a rate of convergence or a nonasymptotic sample complexity bound and show that an asynchronous (or online) version of the algorithm will also work. Preliminary experimental results suggest a faster rate of convergence to a ballpark estimate for our algorithm compared with stochastic approximation-based algorithms.

930,"We investigate a spreading process where each agent is represented by a continuous-time Markov chain with two states, L and M. State L refers to “home,” whereas state M refers to a “meeting place.” When two agents stay together at M, they “meet” and form a contact. This means, according to the application, that they can exchange information, infect each other, perform an act of trade, and so on. We assume that initially all are at state L, and exactly one of the agents possesses a piece of information (or is infected by a contagious disease, etc.) The process can generally be classified as a spreading process with mobile agents, and its simplicity allows us to demonstrate several interesting properties. We provide an efficient way for computing the propagation time and investigate the dependence of the spreading process on parameters such as the number of agents, the number of uninformed agents at the end of the process, and the contact intensity.

931,"Motivated by developments in renewable energy and smart grids, we formulate a stylized mathematical model of a transport network with stochastic load fluctuations. Using an affine control rule, we explore the trade-off between the number of controllable resources in a lossy transport network and the performance gain they yield in terms of expected power losses. Our results are explicit and reveal the interaction between the level of flexibility, the intrinsic load uncertainty, and the network structure.

932,"This paper studies a stochastic model that describes the evolution of vehicle densities in a road network. It is consistent with the class of (deterministic) kinematic wave models, which describe traffic flows based on conservation laws that incorporate the macroscopic fundamental diagram (a functional relationship between vehicle density and flow). Our setup is capable of handling multiple types of vehicle densities, with general macroscopic fundamental diagrams, on a network with arbitrary topology. Interpreting our system as a spatial population process, we derive, under natural scaling, fluid, and diffusion limits. More specifically, the vehicle density process can be approximated with a suitable Gaussian process, which yield accurate normal approximations to the joint (in the spatial and temporal sense) vehicle density process. The corresponding means and variances can be computed efficiently. Along the same lines, we develop an approximation to the vehicles’ travel time distribution between any given origin and destination pair. Finally, we present a series of numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy of the approximations and illustrate the usefulness of the results.

933,"A service system with multiple types of arriving customers is considered. There is an infinite number of homogeneous servers. Multiple customers can be placed for simultaneous service into one server, subject to general packing constraints. The service times of different customers are independent even if they are served simultaneously by the same server; the service time distribution depends on the customer type. Each new arriving customer is placed for service immediately into either an occupied server, that is, one already serving other customers, as long as packing constraints are not violated or into an empty server. After service completion, each customer leaves its server and the system. The basic objective is to minimize the number of occupied servers in steady state. We study a greedy random (GRAND) placement (packing) algorithm, introduced in our previous work. This is a simple online algorithm that places each arriving customer uniformly at random into either one of the already occupied servers that can still fit the customer or one of the so-called zero servers, which are empty servers designated to be available to new arrivals. In our previous work, a version of the algorithm, labeled GRAND(aZ), is considered, in which the number of zero servers is aZ with Z being the current total number of customers in the system and positive a being an algorithm parameter. GRAND(aZ) is shown in our previous work to be asymptotically optimal in the following sense: (a) the steady-state optimality gap grows linearly in the system scale r (the mean total number of customers in service), that is, as c(a)r for some positive c(a), and (b) c(a) vanishes as a goes to zero. In this paper, we consider the GRAND(Zp) algorithm, in which the number of zero servers is Zp, where p < 1 is a fixed parameter, sufficiently close to 1. We prove the asymptotic optimality of GRAND(Zp) in the sense that the steady-state optimality gap is sublinear in the system scale r. This is a stronger form of asymptotic optimality than that of GRAND(aZ).

934,"We develop a new stochastic algorithm for solving pseudomonotone stochastic variational inequalities. Our method builds on Tseng’s forward-backward-forward algorithm, which is known in the deterministic literature to be a valuable alternative to Korpelevich’s extragradient method when solving variational inequalities over a convex and closed set governed by pseudomonotone Lipschitz continuous operators. The main computational advantage of Tseng’s algorithm is that it relies only on a single projection step and two independent queries of a stochastic oracle. Our algorithm incorporates a minibatch sampling mechanism and leads to almost sure convergence to an optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first stochastic look-ahead algorithm achieving this by using only a single projection at each iteration.

935,"Motivated by production systems with nonstationary stochastic demand, we study a double-ended queueing model having back orders and customer abandonment. One side of our model stores back orders, and the other side represents inventory. We assume first-come-first-served instantaneous fulfillment discipline. Our goal is to determine the optimal (nonstationary) production rate over a finite time horizon to minimize the costs incurred by the system. In addition to the inventory-related (holding and perishment) and demand-related (waiting and abandonment) costs, we consider a cost that penalizes rapid fluctuations of production rates. We develop a deterministic fluid-control problem (FCP) that serves as a performance lower bound for the original queueing-control problem (QCP). We further consider a high-volume system for which an upper bound of the gap between the optimal values of the QCP and FCP is characterized and construct an asymptotically optimal production rate for the QCP, under which the FCP lower bound is achieved asymptotically. Demonstrated by numerical examples, the proposed asymptotically optimal production rate successfully captures the time variability of the nonstationary demand.

936,"We propose and study an asymptotically optimal Monte Carlo estimator for steady-state expectations of a d-dimensional reflected Brownian motion (RBM). Our estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense that it requires Õ(d) (up to logarithmic factors in d) independent and identically distributed scalar Gaussian random variables in order to output an estimate with a controlled error. Our construction is based on the analysis of a suitable multilevel Monte Carlo strategy which, we believe, can be applied widely. This is the first algorithm with linear complexity (under suitable regularity conditions) for a steady-state estimation of RBM as the dimension increases.

937,"We establish mean-field limits for large-scale random-access networks with buffer dynamics and arbitrary interference graphs. Although saturated buffer scenarios have been widely investigated and yield useful throughput estimates for persistent sessions, they fail to capture the fluctuations in buffer contents over time and provide no insight in the delay performance of flows with intermittent packet arrivals. Motivated by that issue, we explore in the present paper random-access networks with buffer dynamics, where flows with empty buffers refrain from competition for the medium. The occurrence of empty buffers thus results in a complex dynamic interaction between activity states and buffer contents, which severely complicates the performance analysis. Hence, we focus on a many-sources regime where the total number of nodes grows large, which not only offers mathematical tractability but is also highly relevant with the densification of wireless networks as the Internet of Things emerges. We exploit timescale separation properties to prove that the properly scaled buffer occupancy process converges to the solution of a deterministic initial value problem and establish the existence and uniqueness of the associated fixed point. This approach simplifies the performance analysis of networks with huge numbers of nodes to a low-dimensional fixed-point calculation. For the case of a complete interference graph, we demonstrate asymptotic stability, provide a simple closed form expression for the fixed point, and prove interchange of the mean-field and steady-state limits. This yields asymptotically exact approximations for key performance metrics, in particular the stationary buffer content and packet delay distributions.

938,"This paper considers the problem of optimally controlling the drift of a Brownian motion with a finite set of possible drift rates so as to minimize the long-run average cost, consisting of fixed costs for changing the drift rate, processing costs for maintaining the drift rate, holding costs on the state of the process, and costs for instantaneous controls to keep the process within a prescribed range. We show that, under mild assumptions on the processing costs and the fixed costs for changing the drift rate, there is a strongly ordered optimal policy, that is, an optimal policy that limits the use of each drift rate to a single interval; when the process reaches the upper limit of that interval, the policy either changes to the next lower drift rate deterministically or resorts to instantaneous controls to keep the process within the prescribed range, and when the process reaches the lower limit of the interval, the policy either changes to the next higher drift rate deterministically or again resorts to instantaneous controls to keep the process within the prescribed range. We prove the optimality of such a policy by constructing smooth relative value functions satisfying the associated simplified optimality criteria. This paper shows that, under the proportional changeover cost assumption, each drift rate is active in at most one contiguous range and that the transitions between drift rates are strongly ordered. The results reduce the complexity of proving the optimality of such a policy by proving the existence of optimal relative value functions that constitute a nondecreasing sequence of functions. As a consequence, the constructive arguments lead to a practical procedure for solving the problem that is tens of thousands of times faster than previously reported methods.

939,"In this paper we develop to our best knowledge the first perfect sampling algorithm for queues with Hawkes input (i.e., single-server queues with Hawkes arrivals and independent and identically distributed service times of general distribution). In addition to the stability condition, we also assume the excitation function of the Hawkes process has a light tail and the service time has finite moment-generating function in the neighborhood of the origin. In this procedure, we also propose a new perfect sampling algorithm for Hawkes processes with improved computational efficiency compared with the existing algorithm. Theoretical analysis and numerical tests on the algorithms’ correctness and efficiency are also included.

940,"We study scheduling control of parallel processing networks in which some resources need to simultaneously collaborate to perform some activities and some resources multitask. Resource collaboration and multitasking give rise to synchronization constraints in resource scheduling when the resources are not divisible, that is, when the resources cannot be split. The synchronization constraints affect the system performance significantly. For example, because of those constraints, the system capacity can be strictly less than the capacity of the bottleneck resource. Furthermore, the resource scheduling decisions are not trivial under those constraints. For example, not all static prioritization policies retain the maximum system capacity, and the ones that retain the maximum system capacity do not necessarily minimize the delay (or, in general, the holding cost). We study optimal scheduling control of a class of parallel networks and propose a dynamic prioritization policy that retains the maximum system capacity and is asymptotically optimal in diffusion scale and a conventional heavy-traffic regime with respect to the expected discounted total holding cost objective.

942,"Momentum stochastic gradient descent (MSGD) algorithm has been widely applied to many nonconvex optimization problems in machine learning (e.g., training deep neural networks, variational Bayesian inference, etc.). Despite its empirical success, there is still a lack of theoretical understanding of convergence properties of MSGD. To fill this gap, we propose to analyze the algorithmic behavior of MSGD by diffusion approximations for nonconvex optimization problems with strict saddle points and isolated local optima. Our study shows that the momentum helps escape from saddle points but hurts the convergence within the neighborhood of optima (if without the step size annealing or momentum annealing). Our theoretical discovery partially corroborates the empirical success of MSGD in training deep neural networks.

944,"We study rare event simulations of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) in an orthant. The rare event of interest is that a d-dimensional positive recurrent SRBM enters the set {z∈R+d:∑k=1dzk≥n} before hitting a small neighborhood of the origin {z∈R+d:∑k=1dzk≤ϵ} as n→∞ with a starting point outside the two sets and of order o(n). We show that, under two regularity conditions (the Dupuis–Williams stability condition of the SRBM and the Lipschitz continuity assumption of the associated Skorokhod problem), the probability of the rare event satisfies a large deviation principle. To study the variational problem (VP) for the rare event in two dimensions, we adapt its exact solution from developed by Avram, Dai, and Hasenbein in 2001. In three and higher dimensions, we construct a novel subsolution to the VP under a further assumption that the reflection matrix of the SRBM is a nonsingular M-matrix. Based on the solution/subsolution, particle-based simulation algorithms are constructed to estimate the probability of the rare event. Our estimator is asymptotically optimal for the discretized problem in two dimensions and has exponentially superior performance over standard Monte Carlo in three and higher dimensions. In addition, we establish that the growth rate of the relative bias term arising from discretization is subexponential in all dimensions. Therefore, we can estimate the probability of interest with subexponential complexity growth in two dimensions. In three and higher dimensions, the computational complexity of our estimators has a strictly smaller exponential growth rate than the standard Monte Carlo estimators.

945,"We consider an agent who needs to buy (or sell) a relatively small amount of assets over some fixed short time interval. We work at the highest frequency meaning that we wish to find the optimal tactic to execute our quantity using limit orders, market orders, and cancellations. To solve the agent’s control problem, we build an order book model and optimize an expected utility function based on our price impact. We derive the equations satisfied by the optimal strategy and solve them numerically. Moreover, we show that our optimal tactic enables us to outperform significantly naive execution strategies.

947,"We prove that a single-layer neural network trained with the Q-learning algorithm converges in distribution to a random ordinary differential equation as the size of the model and the number of training steps become large. Analysis of the limit differential equation shows that it has a unique stationary solution that is the solution of the Bellman equation, thus giving the optimal control for the problem. In addition, we study the convergence of the limit differential equation to the stationary solution. As a by-product of our analysis, we obtain the limiting behavior of single-layer neural networks when trained on independent and identically distributed data with stochastic gradient descent under the widely used Xavier initialization.

948,"Novel advanced policy gradient (APG) methods, such as trust region policy optimization and proximal policy optimization (PPO), have become the dominant reinforcement learning algorithms because of their ease of implementation and good practical performance. A conventional setup for notoriously difficult queueing network control problems is a Markov decision problem (MDP) that has three features: infinite state space, unbounded costs, and long-run average cost objective. We extend the theoretical framework of these APG methods for such MDP problems. The resulting PPO algorithm is tested on a parallel-server system and large-size multiclass queueing networks. The algorithm consistently generates control policies that outperform state-of-art heuristics in literature in a variety of load conditions from light to heavy traffic. These policies are demonstrated to be near optimal when the optimal policy can be computed. A key to the successes of our PPO algorithm is the use of three variance reduction techniques in estimating the relative value function via sampling. First, we use a discounted relative value function as an approximation of the relative value function. Second, we propose regenerative simulation to estimate the discounted relative value function. Finally, we incorporate the approximating martingale-process method into the regenerative estimator.

949,"We study a many-server queueing model with server vacations, where the population size dynamics of servers and customers are coupled: a server may leave for vacation only when no customers await, and the capacity available to customers is directly affected by the number of servers on vacation. We focus on scaling regimes in which server dynamics and queue dynamics fluctuate at matching time scales so that their limiting dynamics are coupled. Specifically, we argue that interesting coupled dynamics occur in (a) the Halfin–Whitt regime, (b) the nondegenerate slowdown regime, and (c) the intermediate near Halfin–Whitt regime, whereas the dynamics asymptotically decouple in the other heavy-traffic regimes. We characterize the limiting dynamics, which are different for each scaling regime. We consider relevant respective performance measures for regimes (a) and (b)—namely, the probability of wait and the slowdown. Although closed-form formulas for these performance measures have been derived for models that do not accommodate server vacations, it is difficult to obtain closed-form formulas for these performance measures in the setting with server vacations. Instead, we propose formulas that approximate these performance measures and depend on the steady-state mean number of available servers and previously derived formulas for models without server vacations. We test the accuracy of these formulas numerically.

950,"We propose and analyze a recipient-anonymous stochastic routing model to study a fundamental trade-off between anonymity and routing delay. An agent wants to quickly reach a goal vertex in a network through a sequence of routing actions, whereas an overseeing adversary observes the agent’s entire trajectory and tries to identify the agent’s goal among those vertices traversed. We are interested in understanding the probability that the adversary can correctly identify the agent’s goal (anonymity) as a function of the time it takes the agent to reach it (delay). A key feature of our model is the presence of intrinsic uncertainty in the environment, so that each of the agent’s intended steps is subject to random perturbation and thus may not materialize as planned. Using large-network asymptotics, our main results provide near-optimal characterization of the anonymity–delay trade-off under a number of network topologies. Our main technical contributions are centered on a new class of “noise-harnessing” routing strategies that adaptively combine intrinsic uncertainty from the environment with additional artificial randomization to achieve provably efficient obfuscation.
",We study a dynamic network design problem in which a network is composed of a “smart” network and a “smart” network. The network is composed of a “smart” network and a “smart” network. The smart network is a “smart” network that is capable of detecting and responding to unknown threats. The smart network’s behavior is dependent on the network’s state and the state of the smart network’s state. We propose a dynamic network design problem in which the network’s state is determined by the state of the smart network’s state. We show that the network’s state is determined by the state of the smart network’s state and the state of the smart network’s state. We also show that the network’s state is determined by the state of the smart network’s state and the state of the smart network’s state.

952,"This paper studies the performance of greedy matching algorithms on bipartite graphs G=(J,D,E). We focus primarily on three classical algorithms: RANDOM-EDGE, which sequentially selects random edges from E; RANDOM-VERTEX, which sequentially matches random vertices in J to random neighbors; and RANKING, which generates a random priority order over vertices in D and then sequentially matches random vertices in J to their highest-priority remaining neighbor. Prior work has focused on identifying the worst-case approximation ratio for each algorithm. This guarantee is highest for RANKING and lowest for RANDOM-EDGE. Our work instead studies the average performance of these algorithms when the edge set E is random. Our first result compares RANDOM-VERTEX and RANDOM-EDGE and shows that on average, RANDOM-VERTEX produces more matches. This result holds for finite graphs (in contrast to previous asymptotic results) and also applies to “many to one” matching in which each vertex in D can match with multiple vertices in J. Our second result compares RANDOM-VERTEX and RANKING and shows that the better worst-case guarantee of RANKING does not translate into better average performance. In “one to one” settings where each vertex in D can match with only one vertex in J, the algorithms result in the same number of matches. When each vertex in D can match with two vertices in J, RANDOM-VERTEX produces more matches than RANKING.

954,"This paper uses the generator comparison approach of Stein’s method to analyze the gap between steady-state distributions of Markov chains and diffusion processes. The “standard” generator comparison approach starts with the Poisson equation for the diffusion, and the main technical difficulty is to obtain bounds on the derivatives of the solution to the Poisson equation, also known as Stein factor bounds. In this paper we propose starting with the Poisson equation of the Markov chain; we term this the prelimit approach. Although one still needs Stein factor bounds, they now correspond to finite differences of the Markov chain Poisson equation solution rather than the derivatives of the solution to the diffusion Poisson equation. In certain cases, the former are easier to obtain. We use the M/M/1 model as a simple working example to illustrate our approach.

955,"The paper studies approximations and control of a processor sharing (PS) server where the service rate depends on the number of jobs occupying the server. The control of such a system is implemented by imposing a limit on the number of jobs that can share the server concurrently, with the rest of the jobs waiting in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer. A desirable control scheme should strike the right balance between efficiency (operating at a high service rate) and parallelism (preventing small jobs from getting stuck behind large ones). We use the framework of heavy-traffic diffusion analysis to devise near optimal control heuristics for such a queueing system. However, although the literature on diffusion control of state-dependent queueing systems begins with a sequence of systems and an exogenously defined drift function, we begin with a finite discrete PS server and propose an axiomatic recipe to explicitly construct a sequence of state-dependent PS servers that then yields a drift function. We establish diffusion approximations and use them to obtain insightful and closed-form approximations for the original system under a static concurrency limit control policy. We extend our study to control policies that dynamically adjust the concurrency limit. We provide two novel numerical algorithms to solve the associated diffusion control problem. Our algorithms can be viewed as “average cost” iteration: The first algorithm uses binary-search on the average cost, while the second faster algorithm uses Newton-Raphson method for root finding. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our approximation for choosing optimal or near-optimal static and dynamic concurrency control heuristics.

956,"We consider a distributed server system consisting of a large number of servers, each with limited capacity on multiple resources (CPU, memory, etc.). Jobs with different rewards arrive over time and require certain amounts of resources for the duration of their service. When a job arrives, the system must decide whether to admit it or reject it, and if admitted, in which server to schedule it. The objective is to maximize the expected total reward received by the system. This problem is motivated by control of cloud computing clusters, in which jobs are requests for virtual machines (VMs) or containers that reserve resources for various services, and rewards represent service priority of requests or price paid per time unit of service. We study this problem in an asymptotic regime where the number of servers and jobs’ arrival rates scale by a factor L, as L becomes large. We propose a resource reservation policy that asymptotically achieves at least 1/2, and under certain monotone property on jobs’ rewards and resources, at least 1−1/e of the optimal expected reward. The policy automatically scales the number of VM slots for each job type as the demand changes and decides in which servers the slots should be created in advance, without the knowledge of traffic rates.

957,"We introduce a new class of policies called “delay-join the shortest queue (delay-JSQ)” for use in parallel processing networks with removable servers. When jobs arrive to the system while all servers are on, jobs should be routed to the shortest queue. However, when servers are off, they take a random time to turn back on, which we allow to occur only when the number of jobs in each of the nonempty queues exceeds a fixed threshold. This new class of policies balances the load among all servers that are currently on and balances the capacity by keeping servers off until they are needed. A detailed numerical study shows that at moderate loads (where server farms and increasingly manufacturing facilities operate), delay-JSQ outperforms JSQ by up to 80%. In addition, it does so without precise knowledge of the input parameters and even when the input process is nonstationary.

958,"We study the problem of Bayesian learning in a dynamical system involving strategic agents with asymmetric information. In a series of seminal papers in the literature, this problem has been investigated under a simplifying model where selfish players appear sequentially and act once in the game. It has been shown that there exist information cascades where users discard their private information and mimic the action of their predecessor. In this paper, we provide a framework for studying Bayesian learning dynamics in a more general setting than the one just described. In particular, our model incorporates cases where players can act repeatedly and there is strategic interaction in that each agent’s payoff may also depend on other players’ actions. The proposed framework hinges on a sequential decomposition methodology for finding structured perfect Bayesian equilibria of a general class of dynamic games with asymmetric information. Using this methodology, we study a specific dynamic learning model where players make decisions about public investment based on their estimates of everyone’s states. We characterize a set of informational cascades for this problem where learning stops for the team as a whole. Moreover, we show that such cascades occur almost surely.
","We study a dynamic game in which players compete in a network of agents. We consider a game in which agents are randomly drawn from a network of agents and are randomly drawn from a random set of agents. We show that agents’ behavior is modeled as a stochastic process, and we show that agents’ behavior is modeled as a stochastic process with a stochastic process’s objective function. We show that agents’ behavior is modeled as a stochastic process with a stochastic process’s objective function. We also show that agents’ behavior is modeled as a stochastic process with a stochastic process’s objective function.

959,"A common assumption in the vast literature on the extremes of spectrally one-sided Markov additive processes (MAPs) is that the continuous-time Markov chain that serves as the background process is irreducible. In the present paper, we consider, motivated by, for example, applications in credit risk, the case in which the irreducibility condition has been lifted, thus allowing the presence of one or more transient classes. More specifically, we consider the distribution of the maximum when the MAP under study has only positive jumps (the spectrally positive case) or negative jumps (the spectrally negative case). The methodology used relies on two crucial previous results: (i) the Wiener–Hopf decomposition for Lévy processes and, in particular, its explicit form in spectrally one-sided cases and (ii) a result on the number of singularities of the matrix exponent of a spectrally one-sided MAP. In both the spectrally positive and negative cases, we derive a system of linear equations of which the solution characterizes the distribution of the maximum of the process. As a by-product of our results, we develop a procedure for calculating the maximum of a spectrally one-sided Lévy process over a phase-type distributed time interval.
